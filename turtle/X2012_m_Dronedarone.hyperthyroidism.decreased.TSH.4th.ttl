                         OpenPVSignal:has_content """The most likely diagnosis for the patients in the reports who developed hyperthyroidism on amiodarone is Type II AIT. This may also be true for those who first developed hyperthyroidism on dronedarone. Supporting evidence comes from reports with laboratory results showing an elevated T4 and markedly suppressed TSH. The TSH was increased in one patient with hyperthyroidism (report 5 in Table 2) suggesting an inhibition of monodeiodination as the mechanism rather than AIT in this one report.
Type II AIT is slow to remit after amiodarone is withdrawn and may in fact be exacerbated by withdrawal as the protection against the arrhythmias of hyperthyroidism is removed.
It is therefore possible that patients who had developed hyperthyroidism on amiodarone were still experiencing fluctuating disease while taking dronedarone. Several patients developed a recurrence of atrial fibrillation. This may have been due to dronedarone-induced hyperthyroidism but recurrence of previous thyroid-related atrial arrhythmias may have occurred if dronedarone was less effective than amiodarone at controlling these.
The well-documented reports in Table 1 are the key reports in discussing this issue. Patient 1 had a detailed past history with no mention of hyperthyroidism or exposure to amiodarone.
Although she had a history of diencephalic endocrinopathy and adrenal hyperplasia she had normal adrenal function and was euthyroid prior to starting dronedarone. She also recovered on dechallenge together with thiamazole treatment. The differential diagnoses considered by her physician were Basedow’s (Graves’) disease and dronedarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Patients 2 and 3 had been exposed to amiodarone but there was no mention of previous hyperthyroidism. Also the hyperthyroidism with dronedarone occurred several months after amiodarone was stopped and dronedarone commenced. The fourth case report in Table 1 concerns a patient with a history of amiodarone-induced hyperthryoidism who developed a marked increase in thyroid hormones detected five months after dronedarone was commenced. Amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism can relapse after amiodarone has been discontinued because of the long half-life of this medicine. However, this patient had not taken amiodarone for seven months. He may have experienced a relapse but a de novo effect of dronedarone or an exacerbating or additional effect of dronedarone are alternative explanations.
The reports in Table 2 do not contain past history or narrative, but the duration of dronedarone use, and therefore length of time since any amiodarone use, of 8 months and 14 months for two patients increases the likelihood of a dronedarone adverse effect. The reports provide some evidence for an adverse effect of dronedarone on the thyroid gland causing hyperthyroidism. It may have a destructive effect on the thyroid follicles similar to AIT II, an inherent effect of amiodarone or, in some cases, may exacerbate such effects after they have occurred with amiodarone.""" ;

These effects are common and tend to occur in the first few months of treatment after which serum T4 and TSH levels tend to return to normal. Amiodarone can exert a direct toxic effect on follicular thyrocytes leading initially to hyperthyroidism.
There are two forms of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT), type I AIT and type II AIT. Type I occurs predominantly in areas of iodine deficiency and a high incidence of goitre whereas type II tends to occur where iodine is sufficient and there is a low incidence of toxic multinodular goitre.

Dronedarone is a benzofuran derivate that has been developed to overcome the iodine-associated extra cardiac adverse effects of amiodarone. It has similar clinical indications and a chemically related structure to amiodarone but lacks the iodine component.1 Dronedarone possesses a methane sulphonyl group that decreases its lipophilicity resulting in a shorter half-life and less tissue accumulation than amiodarone. Dronedarone has an elimination half-life of 24 hours compared with up to 100 days for amiodarone. It undergoes considerable hepatic first pass metabolism involving CYP isoenzymes 3A4 and 2D6. It is also an inhibitor of CYP 3A4 and 2D6 and P- glycoprotein transport.
Adverse effects of amiodarone on the thyroid gland
Adverse effects of amiodarone include various thyroid disorders, some attributed to its iodine content and others considered inherent effects of amiodarone. It is useful therefore, before considering the dronedarone reports, to review the mechanisms whereby amiodarone can adversely affect the thyroid gland. The underlying thyroid status of individuals and their environment predispose them to specific amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders.2
The effects on the thyroid due to the iodine content of amiodarone are hypothyroidism in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease and hyperthyroidism in patients with autonomous function in a nodular goitre.
Inherent effects of amiodarone on the thyroid gland
Thyroid dysfunction may occur due to inhibition of 5’-monodeiodination leading to decreased circulating triiodothyronine (T3) and increased reverse T3, thyroxine (T4) and TSH. These effects are common and tend to occur in the first few months of treatment after which serum T4 and TSH levels tend to return to normal. Amiodarone can exert a direct toxic effect on follicular thyrocytes leading initially to hyperthyroidism.
There are two forms of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT), type I AIT and type II AIT. Type I occurs predominantly in areas of iodine deficiency and a high incidence of goitre whereas type II tends to occur where iodine is sufficient and there is a low incidence of toxic multinodular goitre. Type II AIT is due to a direct cytotoxic effect on thyroid follicles leading to an inflammatory reaction and follicular disruption allowing leakage of large amounts of thyroid hormones into the circulation.
If abnormalities in thyroid function do occur with dronedarone it is likely that they will be similar to the adverse thyroid effects attributed to amiodarone but only to those considered inherent effects rather than those attributed to its iodine content. Consideration was therefore given to whether the reports in Vigibase of hyperthyroidism and decreased TSH with dronedarone were in keeping with this hypothesis.""" ;

                   OpenPVSignal:has_content """In VigiBase there are 20 reports of hyperthyroidism and six of decreased TSH attributed to dronedarone. Three reports contained both ADR terms and therefore 23 reports were assessed. The reports originated from ten countries: Austria, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Ireland, Lithuania, Norway, Great Britain and the USA.
Patient Characteristics
Thirteen patients were males, six were females and gender was not specified in four reports. Age was recorded for 18 patients and ranged from 30 to 76 years, mean 61.1 years, median 61.5 years. Indications for dronedarone use, recorded for 18 patients, were atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter and cardiac arrhythmia. Four patients had developed hyperthyroidism while taking amiodarone prior to starting dronedarone. Two other patients also had a history of hyperthyroidism although this was not clearly attributed to amiodarone. One patient had a diencephalic endocrinopathy.
Characteristics of dronedarone use
Daily dose was recorded for 15 patients and was 800 mg (13) or 400 mg (2). Duration of dronedarone use to onset of hyperthyroidism was recorded in 10 reports and was 5 months or less in nine reports and 14 months in the tenth. In reports for decreased TSH but not hyperthyroidism, duration of dronedarone use to onset was not recorded.
Report Assessment
Causality assessment for the reports in these combinations is complicated by the fact that many patients change from amiodarone to dronedarone because of amiodarone adverse effects and these include hyperthyroidism. Some reports indicate that the patient did develop hyperthyroidism on amiodarone prior to starting dronedarone. Other patients were recorded as having pre-existing hyperthyroidism but amiodarone was not described as the cause.
Dronedarone was the sole suspect medicine in 16 reports. Amiodarone was reported as co-suspect in six and described as co-prescribed in three.
However, in reports that included dates, amiodarone was always discontinued before dronedarone was commenced. Thiamazole and metoprolol were co-suspects in one report of decreased TSH. The patient had pre-existing hyperthyroidism and it is unlikely that these medicines caused the abnormality. No other suspect medicines were recorded in the reports.
The reports were divided according to causality assessment and completeness of information especially regarding past history and history of amiodarone use or non-use. Table 1 indicates those reports that were considered by the reviewer to be at least possibly related to dronedarone use and that contained either past history and/or narrative. dronedarone four and five months before hyperthyroidism developed. Patient 4 had developed hyperthyroidism on amiodarone. However, there was a marked increase in thyroid hormones five months after dronedarone was started, seven months after amiodarone was discontinued suggesting a de novo effect of dronedarone or an additive or exacerbating effect on amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Patient 5 had developed an abnormal TSH level on amiodarone although whether this was increased or decreased was not recorded. This patient recovered from extra systoles and thyrotoxicosis when dronedarone was discontinued.
Table 2 contains reports that can be assessed as “possible” based on the information provided but should be interpreted with caution as they lack past history and/or narrative so that previous amiodarone use may not have been documented.
The remaining reports, not included in the tables, contained insufficient information for causality assessment or they contained information that suggested that the reactions were unlikely to be related to dronedarone. The latter reports included narrative information indicating that the patients most likely had amiodarone-related hyperthyroidism.
In the first report in Table 1, the patient recovered when dronedarone was discontinued and treatment for hyperthyroidism commenced.
Although she had a diencephalic endocrinopathy, thyroid and adrenal function were normal on starting dronedarone and there was no history of exposure to amiodarone or hyperthyroidism. She developed severe symptomatic hyperthyroidism with weight loss, tremor, sweating and restlessness. Patients 2 and 3 in Table 1 had no history of hyperthyroidism. Both had been exposed to amiodarone but had changed to dronedarone four and five months before hyperthyroidism developed. Patient 4 had developed hyperthyroidism on amiodarone. However, there was a marked increase in thyroid hormones five months after dronedarone was started, seven months after amiodarone was discontinued suggesting a de novo effect of dronedarone or an additive or exacerbating effect on amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Patient 5 had developed an abnormal TSH level on amiodarone although whether this was increased or decreased was not recorded. This patient recovered from extra systoles and thyrotoxicosis when dronedarone was discontinued. Table 2 contains reports that can be assessed as “possible” based on the information provided but should be interpreted with caution as they lack past history and/or narrative so that previous amiodarone use may not have been documented. The remaining reports, not included in the tables, contained insufficient information for causality assessment or they contained information that suggested that the reactions were unlikely to be related to dronedarone. The latter reports included narrative information indicating that the patients most likely had amiodarone-related hyperthyroidism.""" ;

Response from MAH, Sanofi, regarding a signal between Dronedarone Hyperthyroidism and decreased Thyroid Stimulating Hormone
 
Dronedarone is similar to amiodarone in its molecular structure with an important difference consisting in the absence of iodine in the former. Amiodarone is known to be able to induce thyroid disorders, both hypo and hyperthyroidism, mainly due to the high supply of iodine. However amiodarone may also induce iodine-independent thyroid disorders, involving an immune pathogenetic mechanism, such as amiodarone- induced thyreotoxicosis type II (AIT II).
Theoretically, dronedarone might share the latter class effect, therefore since its launch on the market, close surveillance of thyroid ADRs has been performed by the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) via routine pharmacovigilance, namely in subsequent 6-month Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs). The Risk Management Plan updates coincident with the release of PSURs, refer to thyroid disorders as a potential class effect encouraging regular data review by the MAH. From periodic analyses of the cases reporting thyroid ADRs, the MAH has not confirmed an evidence of a causal link between dronedarone and thyroid disorders including hyperthyroidism. In the Assessment Report to the most recently submitted PSUR (September 2011) EMA endorsed the MAH conclusion on the topic
From launch of dronedarone to 31 January 2012 the MAH has collected worldwide 34 post- marketing cases including the ADR
hyperthyroidism. In most of them only biological abnormality was reported. Analysis of the 34 cases led to exclusion of 18 cases; two due to incompatible chronology, two TSH in favour of hypothyroidism, one iodine-rich contrast media use, one Basedow's disease, three underlying hyperthyroidism with limited information and nine with overall insufficient documentation. In six additional cases pre-existing amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism was reported without details on diagnosis, treatment or outcome. Other five cases reported previous use of amiodarone. The latter may trigger hyperthyroidism at least up to nine months post-withdrawal. When documented, amiodarone use in these cases extended from seven months to two years. The time-to-onset with regard to dronedarone start was of 6 to 13 months. For three cases a single previous normal value of thyroid hormones was stated. For none of the cases recovery or type of corrective treatment were stated. In four of the five remaining cases information on amiodarone exposure was unknown, while in one case it was denied. Time- to-onset in these cases ranged from three to five months. A single normal previous value of thyroid hormones was stated for two cases, in one of which it dated from one year before start of dronedarone. Complete diagnostic workup,
 
corrective treatment and outcome were missing for all. For two cases only echographic findigs were available, showing thyroid gland hypervascularization and enlarged multiheteronodular thyroid gland with zones of hyper and hypoactivity, respectively. In the only case where previous amiodarone use was denied, the patient, a 76-year-old woman was found with moderate hyperthyroidism during hospitalization for recurrence of atrial fibrillation after three months of dronedarone use. Dronedarone was discontinued. No further explorations or diagnostic tests were mentioned. Corrective treatment was not specified. This was the patient with apparently normal thyroid function one year before. Detailed medical history was not available. Concomitant use of alprazolam suggested a pre-existing anxiety. The case documentation elements were not sufficient in order to allow drawing a clear conclusion.
Relatively high prevalence of hyperthyroidism in the general population (0.5 – 2% in women and 10 times less in men in the Whickham survey confirmed by data of other population surveys), mainly elderly, and large worldwide use of dronedarone yielding low number of cases are to be noted. Moreover atrial fibrillation itself may result from baseline hyperthyroidism. Due to these confounding factors combined with lack of relevant information in post-marketing setting further discussion of the data was not possible.
Available preclinical and clinical MAH data are not supportive of dronedarone-induced hyperthyroidism.
When referring to thyroid changes observed with dronedarone in rats and dogs, they were absent (dog) or minor (rat) as compared to amiodarone- induced follicular hypertrophy and hyperplasia. No effect on TSH was noted in these species as compared to a significant effect of amiodarone. In placebo-controlled clinical trial program in the pooled population of close to 3000 patients per arm the incidence of patients with thyroid events including hyperthyroidism was comparable between dronedarone (1.5%) and placebo groups (1.3%). In the DIONYSOS study, an 84.2% relative risk reduction (p = 0.0006) for thyroid disorders was observed in the dronedarone group compared to amiodarone. Four patients receiving amiodarone developed hyperthyroidism versus none in the dronedarone group.
Based on available up-to-date information the MAH concludes that there is no evidence of a causal role of dronedarone in hyperthyroidism.""" ;

In some of the reports found in VigiBase it is possible that patients who developed hyperthyroidism on amiodarone were still experiencing fluctuating disease while taking dronedarone due to the long half-life of amiodarone. There are however reports where there is no history of exposure to amiodarone or where substantial time has passed since the amiodarone treatment ended. The increase in number of reports of hyperthyroidism and decreased thyroid stimulating hormone associated with dronedarone suggests that there may be a relationship where dronedarone either causes the adverse reaction or exacerbates the reaction caused by amiodarone." ;

This may also be true for those who first developed hyperthyroidism on dronedarone. Supporting evidence comes from reports with laboratory results showing an elevated T4 and markedly suppressed TSH. The TSH was increased in one patient with hyperthyroidism (report 5 in Table 2) suggesting an inhibition of monodeiodination as the mechanism rather than AIT in this one report.
Type II AIT is slow to remit after amiodarone is withdrawn and may in fact be exacerbated by withdrawal as the protection against the arrhythmias of hyperthyroidism is removed.
It is therefore possible that patients who had developed hyperthyroidism on amiodarone were still experiencing fluctuating disease while taking dronedarone. Several patients developed a recurrence of atrial fibrillation. This may have been due to dronedarone-induced hyperthyroidism but recurrence of previous thyroid-related atrial arrhythmias may have occurred if dronedarone was less effective than amiodarone at controlling these.""" ;
