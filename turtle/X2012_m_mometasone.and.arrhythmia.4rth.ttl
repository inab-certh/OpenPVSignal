There has been one literature report of AF in association with fluticasone proprionate by the inhalation route and case control studies have shown an increased risk of AF in association with oral corticosteroids. A postulated mechanism by which corticosteroids can cause heart rate disorders involves potassium efflux in cardiac cells.11
It is generally accepted that systemic effects of corticosteroids are considerably less likely with inhaled or intranasal administration but it is possible that these effects may occur in susceptible individuals.
However, there have been no reports in the literature implicating arrhythmias for mometasone. Case reports in VigiBase suggest that there is a signal for the association of mometasone and arrhythmia. Most of the cases have mometasone as the sole suspected drug and a positive dechallenge, supporting a signal. In the few reports that describe the time to onset, it is consistent with a drug-induced effect. Importantly, in four of the cases, the reaction recurred on rechallenge.""" ;

The topical form is presented as a cream or lotion and is indicated for the short term relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Common adverse effects (AEs) of the topical preparations include skin reactions such as pruritus, burning, tingling, signs of skin atrophy and acneiform reactions.1 Other local reactions have also been reported less commonly. The nasal spray is available for treatment of allergic rhinitis, nasal polyps and rhinosinusitis. Systemic absorption is possible from the nasal spray although bioavailability is regarded as low. Common AEs of the nasal preparation include headache, epistaxis and nasal reactions.
Other AEs include rare hypersensitivity reactions and disturbances of taste and smell.2 The dry powder inhalation is available for treatment of asthma, and oral candidiasis is a very common AE. Other common AEs include pharyngitis, headache and dysphonia. There is also potential for hypersensitivity reactions.3
Arrhythmia refers to disturbances in normal cardiac rhythm. It includes a large and heterogeneous group of conditions which arise from abnormal electrical activity in the heart. Arrhythmias can range from minor, common \"skipped beats\" to life-threatening conditions. In general, arrhythmia can refer to disturbances in rate or rhythm but simple disturbances in rate such as bradychardia or tachycardia would usually be coded as such. Arrhythmias may be caused by many different factors including coronary artery disease, electrolyte imbalance, heart muscle disorders and as indicated above, may occur in \"normal, healthy\" hearts.4 A wide range of drugs has been implicated in the development of arrhythmias including antihistamines, sympathomimetics, methylxanthines, anticholinergic drugs, antiarrhythmic drugs and a variety of other drugs including cisapride and erythromycin.5""" ;

The product information also notes that systemic effects were not detected in adults, adolescents or children following the administration of mometasone aqueous nasal spray.2 Oteri and colleagues reported the development of a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) with fast ventricular response after the administration of a different inhaled corticosteroid, fluticasone propionate, to a 15 year old boy, which resolved after discontinuation of the drug. The patient had a history of allergic asthma and had been treated for several years with cetirizine and inhaled mometasone to treat seasonal allergic rhinitis.7 The authors noted that corticosteroid-induced AF had previously been reported in three case control studies.8-10 Huerta et al. reported a twofold increased risk of AF among users of oral corticosteroids compared with nonusers.
Conversely, no increased risk was found among users of inhaled corticosteroids. The results of a large population-based case control study, conducted in Denmark, showed an almost doubled risk of AF or flutter associated with systemic corticosteroid use, with respect to nonuse, in patients with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma and cardiovascular diseases.9 Van der Hooft also reported an increase in the risk of AF among users of systemic corticosteroids in a study which involved 385 cases of AF from the Netherlands.10 It has been postulated that high doses of corticosteroids mediate potassium efflux via a direct effect on the cell membrane, which may induce arrhythmogenesis.11""" ;

                   OpenPVSignal:has_content """As of March 2012 there are 15 individual case safety reports (ICSRs) of arrhythmia and two ICSRs of atrial arrhythmia in association with mometasone in the WHO Global ICSR database,VigiBaseTM. One report was excluded from the analysis as it was a neonatal with congenital heart disease which leaves 16 reports in total. It should be noted that these associations were generated using a different signal identifying process which relies on the Lasso Logistic Regression value and does not require the IC025 to be positive.6 The reports were submitted from the US (13 cases), the UK, Sweden and Switzerland (one case13 each). The patients ranged in age from 12 to 79 years with a median of 57 years in the 12 cases in which this information was provided. In the 14 cases which provided the information, the gender distribution was relatively even with 6 males and 8 females. Noteworthy is that six reports were consumer reports. Out of the rest of the reports one had no reporter type listed and nine reports came from physicians, pharmacists and other health care professionals. Mometasone was the only drug suspected in 13 cases and only three of these listed concomitant drugs. One of the remaining three cases had one co-suspected drug, one case had two other suspected drugs and in case 10 it was shown on the original report that the reporter had listed mometasone as a concomitant drug. Out of the cases that listed concomitant drugs there was no pattern in the drugs reported as concomitant apart from the occasional use of vitamins, minerals and calcium. Mometasone was administered intranasally in the majority (13) of the cases with two reports of inhalation and one of topical use.
Time to onset was reported in only three of the reports and ranged from the same day up to three months. The duration of use was recorded in three additional reports and was three to four days in two cases and two months in another. A positive dechallenge from mometasone was recorded in nine cases. The indication for use of mometasone was reported in ten cases and included allergic conditions or nasal polyps in eight cases, psoriasis in the case where mometasone was used topically and asthma in one of the cases of inhalational use.
As noted in Table 1, the reported reaction was unspecified arrhythmia in 12 cases and tachycardia, heart rate abnormal and extrasystoles in the remaining cases. Eight of the cases reported more than one term relating to arrhythmia such as palpitations, atrial fibrillation, sick sinus syndrome and atrioventricular block. Some of these terms were also reported by themselves as reactions to mometasone or in combination with other heart rate related terms than arrhythmia, but these reports were not included in this analysis. Three patients had a past history of arrhythmia. In case 1 the patient had a history of Wolff-Parkinson- White syndrome but had not had any symptoms for six years when after three days of mometasone use the patient experienced arrhythmia. In case 3 arrhythmia was included in the patient's medical history without further explanations and in case 13 the patient had occasional extra heart beats that increased strongly when mometasone was administered and disappeared upon removal of the drug.
The same thing happened when trying to use the drug 6 months later. Four cases in total, reported that the reaction recurred on rechallenge.""" ;

                OpenPVSignal:has_content "Mometasone is a synthetic corticosteroid with anti- inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties, it is available in three dosage forms: topical, nasal spray and dry powder inhalation. In VigiBaseTM there are currently (March 2012) 15 reports of arrhythmia and two reports of atrial arrhythmia in association with mometasone. The reports are from the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden and Switzerland. Mometasone had been withdrawn in ten cases and the reaction recurred on rechallenge in three of the cases. Case control studies have demonstrated an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) in association with oral corticosteroid use and a mechanism has been proposed. The possibility of systemic reactions in association with intranasal, inhaled or topical corticosteroids is considered low but there has been one literature report of AF in association with fluticasone. Case reports in VigiBase suggest that there is a signal for the association of mometasone and arrhythmia." ;
