Ondansetron is sometimes mentioned in association with the serotonin syndrome in the literature and there are some published case reports, however nothing is mentioned about serotonin toxicity in the product labelling for ondansetron.

                   OpenPVSignal:has_content """VigiBase contains nine ICSRs of serotonin syndrome in association with ondansetron use, many of them quite complex and with alternative explanations. Seven of the cases describe a plausible time to onset, as the reaction occurred on the same day or the day after ondansetron was first administered to the patient. Several cases report a positive dechallenge but it is impossible to fully evaluate this information since not only ondansetron but also other suspect drugs were withdrawn.
Seven of the cases report other drugs that, alone or in combination with other drugs, are known to have the ability to cause serotonin syndrome. Co- administration of different drugs affecting the serotonergic system is a known risk of developing the syndrome. It is not possible to completely assess the involvement of ondansetron in the cases including several other suspect drugs, but it is also impossible to rule out that ondansetron had a contributory role. Interestingly, some of the cases have no or only one other suspect drug in addition to ondansetron.
A mechanism for a suggested increased vulnerability to serotonin syndrome when concomitantly using 5-HT3 antagonists and other serotonergic drugs might be that blocking of the 5-HT3 receptor subtype, and at the same time increasing the levels of serotonin, results in excessive serotonin to other serotonin receptor subtypes (including 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A).7,10 A pharmacokinetic interaction might also be considered, as ondansetron is metabolized by
cytochrome P-450 enzymes; CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and
CYP1A21.
Two of the cases concern children and in both cases ondansetron is the only drug administered. Although there are certain circumstances complicating the assessment of these cases, i.e. history of malignant hyperthermia and overdose, it should be considered whether ondansetron may cause the serotonin syndrome without co- administration of other drugs affecting the serotonin system and whether children might be at higher risk of serotonin toxicity from ondansetron only.
Ondansetron is a widely used drug, however, the number of reports of ondansetron associated with serotonin syndrome in VigiBase is quite low. This might indicate that an association between the drug and the ADR is rare, but it should also be considered that serotonin syndrome is not always recognized as a diagnosis and hence not reported as such. Mackay et al. found that awareness of the serotonin syndrome among prescribing doctors was poor; 85% of general practitioners in the United Kingdom were unaware of the syndrome as a diagnosis.13""" ;

Therapeutic indications include the management of nausea and vomiti.ng induced by cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy (for patients aged 6 months and older), and the prevention and treatment of post- operative nausea and vomiting (for patients aged one month and older).1,2 The recommended adult dose ranges from a single dose of 4 mg to 32 mg a day.1
Serotonin syndrome is a drug-induced condition resulting from use of medications that increase the level of intrasynaptic serotonin, primarily acting at serotonin receptor subtype 5-HT2A and possibly 5- HT1A.3,4 Several drugs have, either alone or in combination, been associated with the syndrome, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and opioids.3 The diagnosis is clinical and symptoms include mental status alterations (agitation and confusion), autonomic signs (fever, diaphoresis, tachypnoea and tachycardia) and neuromuscular changes (tremor, clonus, myoclonus, hyperreflexia and rigidity).3 The onset of symptoms is usually rapid.
Mason et al. found that patients with serotonin syndrome most often presented within 24 hours of medication initiation, an overdose or a change in dosing.5 Symptoms usually resolve within 24 hours after discontinuation of serotonergic drugs and the initiation of supportive therapy, but symptoms may last longer after use of drugs with long elimination half-life or active metabolites.4""" ;

Other ADRs listed as common for ondansetron (frequency >1/100 and
<1/10) are sensation of warmth or flushing, constipation and local injection site reactions. Concomitant use with apomorphine is contra- indicated, based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness.1
Five case reports on serotonin syndrome associated with the use of ondansetron were found published in the literature.7-12 Four of the cases were identified in VigiBase and are further described in the next section. The fifth case involves a 12 year old male patient seriously ill with disseminated Ewing's Sarcoma, receiving mirtazapine and morphine in addition to chemotherapy. The following day after starting ondansetron he was confused and tremulous with myoclonus.

Mirtazapine was reintroduced several days later

                   OpenPVSignal:has_content "After exclusion of duplicate reports, there are nine unique individual case safety reports (ICSRs) of ondansetron associated with the serotonin syndrome in the WHO Global ICSR database, VigiBase™, as of January 2012. The cases originate from seven different countries; United States, Canada, Spain, New Zealand, Germany, United Kingdom and Australia. Six of the patients are females and three are males. Patient age ranges from 12 months to 69 years. Five of the cases have a time to onset reported; the reaction then started on the day of the first ondansetron administration or on the following day. In the adult cases, ondansetron dose ranges from a single dose of 4 mg up to 16 mg daily. The characteristics of the individual cases are listed in Table 1 (unpublished cases) and Table 2 (published cases). In addition to the information available on the cases in VigiBase, further information has been retrieved from original reports received from the national pharmacovigilance centres from which the reports originated, or from the published case reports. In addition to the ondansetron case reports, there are five cases of other 5-HT3 antagonists associated with serotonin syndrome in VigiBase (one duplicate excluded). Three cases include granisetron and two cases dolasetron. One case was found published in literature and reports an 11 year-old female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient developed symptoms of serotonin syndrome when a worsening medical condition led to compromised endothelial function, coinciding with the use of granisetron and fentanyl.7 The second case reports a 69 year-old female. Suspected drugs include granisetron, venlafaxine, sufentanil and methylthioninium and the reporter mentions the suspicion of interaction between venlafaxine and methylthioninium, with contributions from the other drugs. Venlafaxine had been used for almost one year when adding the other three drugs and serotonin syndrome started with a latency of hours after start of the new drugs. The third case reports a 12 year-old male with acute lymphatic leukaemia. Granisetron and olanzapine were reported as suspected drugs, but many concomitant drugs were also mentioned, including fentanyl and other anaesthetics. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome was reported as an additional ADR. The two cases involving dolasetron report sertraline as a co-suspected drug. These reports are very poorly documented." ;

Mason et al. found that patients with serotonin syndrome most often presented within 24 hours of medication initiation, an overdose or a change in dosing.5 Symptoms usually resolve within 24 hours after discontinuation of serotonergic drugs and the initiation of supportive therapy, but symptoms may last longer after use of drugs with long elimination half-life or active metabolites.4" ;

Ondansetron is sometimes mentioned in association with serotonin syndrome in the literature, and there are some published case reports. Nothing, however, is mentioned about serotonin toxicity neither in the UK Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) nor in the US FDA product labelling. There are nine individual case safety reports (ICSRs) in VigiBase, out of which four have been published in literature. In addition to the ondansetron cases, there are five cases of other 5-HT3 antagonists associated with serotonin syndrome in VigiBase; three cases with granisetron and two cases with dolasetron. VigiBase case reports, together with published case reports, indicate that ondansetron may contribute to the development of the serotonin syndrome in susceptible patients concomitantly receiving other drugs affecting the serotonin system." ;
