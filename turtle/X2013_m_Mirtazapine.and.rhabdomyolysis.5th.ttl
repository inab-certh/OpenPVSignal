In the cases assessed in this analysis there are several confounders, such as co-reported drugs known to cause rhabdomyolysis, alcohol intoxication and possible infection. Rhabdomyolysis may be secondary to muscle rigidity seen in patients with serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
Serotonin syndrome was listed in three cases and neuroleptic malignant syndrome was listed in one case. Other co-reported terms of interest included hypertonia, convulsions, involuntary muscle contractions and extrapyramidal disorders which all might, theoretically and if severe enough, have contributed to the rhabdomyolysis.
Data on causality assessment, co-morbidities and de-and re-challenge was extremely limited. In the 27 cases where information on causality assessment was given, 21 were graded as possible, three were not (yet) assessed, two were probable (one according to narrative information) and one was recorded as unknown. 17 reports provided information on co-morbidities, a few with possible confounders such as alcoholism and high cholesterol (statin use). De-challenge information was provided on 30 of the ICSRs; the drug was withdrawn in 26 cases and in eight of these it was mentioned that the reaction abated. Only one positive re-challenge was reported. Outcome was stated on 91% (43/47) of the ICSRs. 31 patients had recovered or were recovering, two of these with sequelae, three had not recovered at the time of reporting, one patient died and in eight cases the outcome was unknown""" ;

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content """The drug-ADR combination mirtazapine and rhabdomyolysis was published in the Signal document in 2000 describing 15 Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) from six countries with myositis, rhabdomyolysis and neuroleptic malignant syndrome in relation to either mirtazapine or mianserin.1 Mirtazapine and rhabdomyolysis was again highlighted during a research project at the UMC and prompted further review.2
The mianserin analogue, mirtazapine, is a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) and is broadly classified as a centrally acting presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Structurally it can be classified as a tetracyclic antidepressant. Mirtazapine acts by enhancing the release of noradrenaline and by blocking central presynaptic adrenergic receptors. It is a potent antagonist at histamine (H1) receptors which is responsible for the drug's sedative properties.3
Mirtazapine is primarily used as an anti- depressant, but can also be prescribed to treat anxiety disorders such as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), panic disorder and post-traumatic stress. It has been investigated in the management of nausea and vomiting. Mirtazapine is generally well tolerated and has a faster onset of efficacy (one week) than other comparable antidepressants. As the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 is involved in the metabolism of mirtazapine, caution is advised when mirtazapine is given with potent inhibitors of this isoenzyme. The concomitant use of mirtazapine with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated as it may lead to serotonin syndrome.3
Mirtazapine is usually administered orally, but may also be given by intravenous infusion. The initial oral daily dose is 15-30 mg for the treatment of depression, but may be increased gradually according to response. The usual dose ranges between 15 and 45 mg once or twice daily.3,4
Common side effects of mirtazapine are increased appetite and weight, oedema, and drowsiness or sedation in the first weeks of treatment. Other less common or rare side effects of interest include paraesthesia, convulsions, tremor, myoclonus, akathisia, arthralgia, myalgia, muscle rigidity, neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome.3,5
Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle fibers that leads to the release of myoglobin into the bloodstream. Normally, myoglobin is loosely bound to plasma globulins and only small amounts reach the urine but when large amounts are released the binding capacity of the plasma protein is exceeded. Myoglobin is filtered out of the body via the kidneys and may cause obstruction in the tubules and renal dysfunction. Rhabdomyolysis is one of the leading causes of acute renal failure and although it may be fatal, it is usually relatively benign. Rhabdomyolysis may be caused by any condition that damages skeletal muscles, especially injury or strainful exercise, the toxic effect of drugs such as statins and/or fibrates, illegal drugs and/or alcohol abuse. Other risk factors include electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalaemia and hypernatraemia, infections, electric shock and occlusion of blood supply to muscles. Management may include the infusion of bicarbonate-containing fluids (to enhance urinary secretion of myoglobin) or hemodialysis.6,7,8""" ;

A literature search revealed four published cases, all of which had been reported to VigiBase. The first concerns a 74 year old man from the US with a history of major depressive disorder who was brought to the emergency department for odd behaviour. He had started taking mirtazapine four months earlier and had been using lisinopril for two years.

                   OpenPVSignal:has_content """As of 24 April 2013, 61 ICSRs mentioning mirtazapine and rhabdomyolysis were found in the WHO Global ICSR Database, VigiBase™, with an IC value of 0.81 and IC025 of 0.43. This number was reduced to 47 reports after duplicates were removed. Gender was provided for all ICSRs with 31 concerning men and 16 women. Age was mentioned on 89% (42/47) of the ICSRs ranging from a newborn (transplacental transmission) to an 84 year old, with a median age of 43.5 years.
Twelve countries, across three continents, had reported this suspected drug-ADR combination; Germany had 17 cases, United States and Switzerland six each, Spain five, Canada and United Kingdom three each, Australia two and Greece, Czech Republic, Denmark, France and the Netherlands had one case each. The first ICSR entered into VigiBase was from Spain in 1999 and the last was from Switzerland in 2012.
Mirtazapine was the sole suspected drug on 18 ICSRs. Co-suspected or interacting drugs of interest included lamotrigine, venlafaxine, risperidone, pregabalin, escitalopram, citalopram, olanzapine, quetiapine, pramipexole, atorvastatin and ziprasidone which are all known to cause rhabdomyolysis.9 Concomitant drugs were reported on 21 ICSRs.
Where dose was stated, it was generally ranging from 15 to 45 mg daily. Among the ICSRs there were six cases of suicide attempt. In two of these cases suicide attempt is not specifically stated, but in one case the dose taken was 1.7 g and this case was also found in literature where it was described as a suicide attempt.10 In the other case, the term overdose was reported (the patient had taken 840 mg) but it was unclear if it was intentional. There was also one case where an infant developed rhabdomyolysis following in utero exposure to mirtazapine and venlafaxine, when the mother attempted suicide by overdosing on these medicines.11
Treatment dates were given on less than half of the ICSRs (21), ranging from four days to four years. The reported time to onset ranged from three days to seven months from starting mirtazapine.

                OpenPVSignal:has_content "Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle fibers that leads to the release of myoglobin into the bloodstream. Normally, myoglobin is loosely bound to plasma globulins and only small amounts reach the urine but when large amounts are released the binding capacity of the plasma protein is exceeded. Myoglobin is filtered out of the body via the kidneys and may cause obstruction in the tubules and renal dysfunction. Rhabdomyolysis is one of the leading causes of acute renal failure and although it may be fatal, it is usually relatively benign. Rhabdomyolysis may be caused by any condition that damages skeletal muscles, especially injury or strainful exercise, the toxic effect of drugs such as statins and/or fibrates, illegal drugs and/or alcohol abuse. Other risk factors include electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalaemia and hypernatraemia, infections, electric shock and occlusion of blood supply to muscles. Management may include the infusion of bicarbonate-containing fluids (to enhance urinary secretion of myoglobin) or hemodialysis.6,7,8" ;

This follow- up shows that in February 2013, the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Database, VigiBase™, contained 47 ICSRs, but the ADR is not labelled in the UK Summary of Product Characteristics or US FDA Label. A literature search reveals that four of the cases found in VigiBase have been published and the information these provide together with the assessment of the other ICSRs suggest that the association of rhabdomyolysis with mirtazapine is a signal and should be investigated further." ;
