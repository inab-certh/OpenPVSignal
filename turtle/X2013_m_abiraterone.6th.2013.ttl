Platelets have a circulating lifespan of around 10 days, and about one third of the platelets are sequestered in the spleen at any time. Approximately 100 x 109 platelets must be released from mature megakaryocytes into the circulation each day in order to maintain a normal platelet count.20 In the ICSRs, abiraterone treatment durations range from 18 days to four months. The temporal relationship between the start of abiraterone therapy and reported thrombocytopenia would suggest a process affecting platelet production, more prolonged than the mechanism of immune DIT. In the literature, an observational study12 reports two cases of thrombocytopenia (5%) in 39 patients treated with abiraterone and this combined with the analysis of reports in VigiBase, would suggest that abiraterone might be associated with thrombocytopenia, and requires further investigation." ;

Metastatic cancer with bone marrow involvement can also cause thrombo-cytopenia and can act as a confounder: out of five cases reporting concomitant anaemia or pancytopenia, in three cases (case 5, 11 and 19) bone marrow puncture found evidence of carcinosis, and in case 9, spleen enlargement is also reported with thrombocytopenia and normocytic anaemia. In spite of these two main limitations, the analysis of the 25 ICSRs seems to show a predominant pattern of onset of two or more weeks, which would be consistent with a drug-induced thrombocytopenia through a non- immune mechanism. In case 15, thrombocytopenia may be related to the co-suspected drug teicoplanin (time to thrombo-cytopenia onset is reported 11 days after teicoplanin treatment and 56 days after abiraterone treatment). In all other cases with co- suspected or concomitant drugs, temporal relationships suggest that abiraterone is the most likely causative agent. Diclofenac can cause thrombocytopenia - chronic and silent or acute, through an immune mechanism: in case 5 (causality assessed as \"certain\"), thrombocytopenia's onset occurred after 46 days of abiraterone therapy and 5 months of diclofenac treatment.16 Leuprorelin, that can rarely cause thrombocytopenia, was given from an unknown date in case 3, 19 and 23, and for 22 months in case 5. Clopidogrel, that impairs platelet function, was given from an unknown date to a patient who recovered from thrombocytopenia with no dose (SSRIs) have been linked to platelet dysfunction as a consequence of serotonin-uptake blockade into platelets: however, in case 6, no dates are given for citalopram, and in case 23 duloxetine was given from an unknown date. In case 25, the patient had long-term treatment with dalteparin because of a history of pulmonary embolism and presented with pulmonary embolism and thrombocytopenia 68 days after starting treatment with abiraterone. Gender differences in platelet function are well known, although the role of endogenous and synthetic hormones has not been fully elucidated.17 Androgens affect red blood cell production and anaemia is a known effect of testosterone suppression. It has been hypothesized that sex hormones may have a role in the production of platelets from megakaryocytes.17 For instance, it has been shown that in vitro human platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid is enhanced by androgens, and androgen therapy has improved platelet counts in patients with myelodysplasia and thrombocytopenia.18,19 The drop in endogenous androgens through CYP17 inhibition by abiraterone may be a factor in the development of thrombocytopenia in patients with other predisposing factors. changes (case 23).

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content """In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) it has been suggested that androgens from non gonadal sources (both adrenal and intratumoral) continue to drive androgen receptors' (AR) signaling and contribute to prostate cancer progression after androgen deprivation therapy. Systemic inhibition of androgen biosynthesis may be achieved through the inhibition of CYP17, which blocks two sequential reactions involved in the final stages of androgen production.1

Abiraterone acetate is a potent and selective CYP17 inhibitor, including both 17,20-lyase and 17-alpha-hydroxylase activities.2,3,4 It blocks the synthesis of androgens in the testis, adrenal glands, and prostate, without causing adrenal insufficiency, which is a known side effect of the non-selective CYP17 inhibitor keto-conazole. The effect of abiraterone on CYP17 differs from the effect of ketoconazole in being irreversible, selective and 10-times more potent.1-5 In order to avoid or prevent clinical consequences of abiraterone's effect on corticosteroid endogenous
	 synthesis, prednisone or prednisolone have to be administered together with abiraterone.

Normal platelet count in humans ranges from 150x109/L to 400x109/L. Thrombocytopenia is usually defined as the platelet count <100x109/L or >50% drop in the platelet count from the baseline. Severe thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count <50x109/L, involves a greater risk of bleeding. With a platelet count below 10x109/L, the risk for spontaneous bleeding (mucocutaneous, intracranial or gastrointestinal) increases rapidly and may even result in patient mortality.6,7

Drug-induced thrombocytopenia (DIT) is a relatively common adverse drug reaction; when severe, its consequences may be serious.7,8 Two main pathways for DIT have been described: a decrease in platelet production â€” mainly because of bone marrow toxicity, i.e. a non-immune mechanism; and an increase in platelet destruction, predominantly caused by immune mechanisms but also by non-immune mechanisms.7,11


Drug-induced non-immune thrombocytopenia can result from a loss of bone marrow cellularity and an impairment of megakaryocyte proliferation and maturation.9 The time course of DIT related to marrow suppression is generally slow, reflecting the time required to deplete the megakaryocyte population.9 Cytotoxic chemotherapy causes thrombocytopenia by bone-marrow suppression; selective inhibition of megakaryocyte production, mediated by thiazide diuretics, ethanol, tolbutamide and antivirals, could lead to isolated thrombocytopenia.6, 8


Non-immune platelet destruction, associated with a small number of antineoplastic agents such as bleomycin, can occur in thrombotic microangiopathy. Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia is characterized by drug-dependent antibodies that bind to platelets and cause their destruction, and can be triggered by a wide range of medications, including cytotoxic agents. In immunemediated thrombocytopenia, time to onset is reported.

to be on the order of 1 to 2 weeks following the patient's first exposure to an immunogenic drug, and of 2-3 days if the drug has been taken previously. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, which affects up to 10% of patients treated (especially with unfractionated heparin), produce immune complexes that induce platelet activation and typically occurs five or more days after the start of heparin therapy. It can be complicated by arterial or venous thrombotic events.8,10

No other haematologic Grade 2, 3 or 4 abnormality (i.e. neutrophils, platelets, WBC) during treatment occurred in greater than 5% of subjects in the abiraterone acetate group or in greater than 3% of subjects in the placebo group\".4 A PubMed search using the search query \"abiraterone AND thrombocytopenia\" retrieved only one result, an article in German reporting the first clinical experiences of abiraterone in compassionate use.12 In this article, two patients, of 39 treated with abiraterone acetate, presented with thrombocytopenia. No results were found for PubMed searches using the search query \"abiraterone AND platelet\" or \"abiraterone AND megakaryocyte\". In the published reports of two Phase III abiraterone trials, (COU-AA-301 final report13 and COU-AA-302 interim analysis14) there is no mention of thrombo-cytopenia or a decrease in platelet counts as an adverse effect. Of note, case 5 reports thrombocytopenia in a participant of the COU-AA-302 trial. In www.clinicaltrials.gov only one clinical trial with abiraterone has results posted (March 2013). Neither thrombocytopenia nor platelet count decreased are listed as adverse events.15" ;

The effect of abiraterone on CYP17 differs from the effect of ketoconazole in being irreversible, selective and 10-times more potent.1-5 In order to avoid or prevent clinical consequences of abiraterone's effect on corticosteroid endogenoussynthesis, prednisone or prednisolone have to be administered together with abiraterone." ;

                   OpenPVSignal:has_content "A total of 26 Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) were retrieved from the WHO Global ICSR Database, VigiBaseâ„¢ on April 16th 2013 and reviewed case by case. The ICSRs came from the United Kingdom (seven), Germany (seven), the United States (six), Spain, Austria and Canada (two cases each). A likely duplicate report from Germany was identified, therefore only 25 cases were considered. The two ICSRs from Spain (case 4 and case 13) show many similarities but have been considered as two different reports. Most of the ICSRs (88%) are spontaneous reports and data are scarce in many of them. Age (reported in 12 ICSRs) ranged from 58 to 85 years, and masculine sex is stated in all cases but two. The dose for abiraterone (1 g daily) was reported in 23 cases (92%). The reports were classed as serious in all but one ICSR (96%), and there were three fatal cases. The main characteristics of the ICSRs are shown in Table 1. Abiraterone is reported as the only suspected drug in 20 ICSRs (80%), and in 10 ICSRs (40%), abiraterone is the only drug mentioned. Co-suspected drugs are prednisolone (two cases), prednisone (two cases, in one case together with an unspecified antiplatelet therapy), and teicoplanin (one case). Prednisone is reported as a concomitant drug in seven other cases and prednisolone in three cases. Suspected and concomitant medications are shown in Table 1. Time to onset is stated in 12 out of 25 ICSRs (48%). Apart from one case which reports â€” perhaps by mistake â€” a minus 15 days time to onset, the remaining 11 ICSRs (44%) report times to onset ranging from 18 days to four months. In seven cases, where time to onset cannot be determined, the duration of treatment for abiraterone has been reported as one month (four cases), three days, and 76 days; one report mentions 18 cycles. Platelet count was reported in eight ICSRs. Thrombocytopenia was severe in four cases (one case with 5,000 platelets and three cases with 19,000 platelets). Moderate thrombocytopenia was reported in three ICSRs with a platelet count of 39,000 (case 2), 26-24,000 (case 24), and 54,000/46,000 (case 25) and two cases reported mild thrombocytopenia (100,000 platelets in case 9 and 68,000 platelets in case 19). Abiraterone was withdrawn in seven cases: two patients recovered (one with sequelae), two patients were reported as not recovered at the date of report, there was one case with unknown outcome, one death, and one with no reported outcome. Dose was reported as not changed in seven cases: in four cases the reported outcome was \"recovered\" (two cases) or \"recovering\" (two cases), in one case the outcome was \"not recovered\" and the outcome was unknown in the two remaining cases. Recurrence after rechallenge is mentioned in one report, with no more data available. In 11 ICSRs (44%), causality was assessed as possible, and in nine (37.5%) causality is not reported. Among the remaining five ICSRs, two were reported as conditional, two as very likely/certain and one as not related. Anaemia is co-reported as an adverse effect in four reports (one of which also reported spleen enlarged), and leucocytopenia is co-reported in two reports. There was one patient with myelodysplasia. Progression of pre-existing disease is reported as an adverse drug reaction in case 20 (with fatal outcome) and case 22. Three deaths were reported. Case 7 reports the death of a man after 76 days of abiraterone treatment; no time to onset is reported. Other adverse effects are also reported for this patient, including oedema peripheral and hypokalemia. Case 20 reports the death of a man after three days of abiraterone/prednisone treatment (disease progression is also mentioned as an adverse effect). In case 24, a 63-year-old patient with advanced metastasic prostate cancer (bone and liver metastases and urinary tract obstruction) presented with acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia and hyperbilirubinemia 58 days after starting abiraterone/prednisone treatment; thrombocytopenia was assessed as not related, hepatic insufficiency as possible and hyperbilirubinaemia as probable (patient from clinical trial). Of the three ICSRs from clinical trials, in two, the association between abiraterone and thrombocytopenia was assessed as certain or very likely and in the other case (described above) as not related. In case 5 (from clinical trial COU-AA- 302, causality assessed as certain) a 69-year-old patient was hospitalized because of grade 3 thrombocytopenia, which worsened in spite of administration of one pack of platelet concentrate together with two packs of blood cells concentrate; he also presented with grade 2 anaemia; further biopsia revealed carcinosis. In case 25, with causality assessed as very likely/certain, a 70- year-old patient hospitalized because of symptoms of pulmonary embolism 66 days after having started the therapy with abiraterone also presented with non-serious thrombocytopenia (54.000 platelets/mL). This patient, with a medical history of pulmonary embolism and with a long- term dalteparin treatment as preventive therapy, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia two months later ." ;

This is in response to the WHO Signal report of 25 Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) that were retrieved from VigiBaseâ„¢. (September 2011 - April 16th 2013) of thrombocytopenia in patients receiving abiraterone acetate. Data are provided below from a thorough Company investigation in March 2013 to assess the potential causal relationship between thrombocytopenia and abiraterone acetate. The Company concludes that thrombocytopenia is not associated with the use of abiraterone acetate, but continues to monitor and review the signal in Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Reports.


Epidemiology

Thrombocytopenia is an expected condition in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, particularly in patients with bone marrow metastasis. The cause of the thrombocytopenia can be multifactorial, including the underlying disease, concurrent medical conditions, or concomitant therapies. A low platelet count may be caused by replacement of bone marrow with metastatic prostatic carcinoma or the result of chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) syndrome (Ruffion 2000), which is common in patients with prostate cancer and is associated
 



with progressive disease. Its incidence is approximately 13% to 30%; however, only 0.4% to 1.65% of patients present with clinical signs and symptoms. Thus this disease-related cause for thrombocytopenia typically goes undetected (Smith 1999). Bone marrow metastasis can also result in anemia and thrombocytopenia (Neider 2010).



Preclinical and Clinical Data from Company-sponsored Studies

Data from pivotal toxicology studies in rats (26 weeks) and monkeys (39 weeks), administered abiraterone at doses that were 5-fold and 2-fold higher, respectively, than clinical exposure, showed only a minimal decrease in platelet count in rats and no decrease in platelet count in monkeys.

In 2 randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (COU-AA-301 and COU-AA-302) with prostate cancer treated with abiraterone acetate, the incidence of thrombocytopenia and platelet count decrease was similar among subjects who received abiraterone acetate (3.0% and 1.2%, respectively) and those who did not (2.5% and 0.9%, respectively) (table 1).

The median exposure (i.e., time on treatment) to abiraterone acetate was approximately twice as long as that of placebo. An analysis adjusted for the duration of exposure (with rates reported as the number of events per 100 subject-years of exposure) showed lower rates of thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreases in the abiraterone acetate group (5.0 and 2.3, respectively) than in the placebo group (5.3 and

3.2, respectively) (Table 2). The data support the conclusion that thrombocytopenia is not associated with the use of abiraterone acetate.

Analysis of Individual Case Safety Reports

Recently, the Company searched its own safety database for all medically confirmed and valid cases of thrombocytopenia, regardless of causality, that were reported in patients receiving abiraterone acetate from launch (28 April 2011) through March 15th 2013. Seventy-one spontaneous, clinical study and registry cases (median age of 69 years) from 19 countries were retrieved. The latency from the initiation of abiraterone acetate therapy to the first onset of thrombocytopenia was <1 month in 11 cases, 1 to 3 months in 19 cases, 3 to 6 months in 8 cases, >6 months in 7 cases, and not reported in 26 cases. All cases were reviewed for a potential drug effect relationship in accordance with the CIOMS Threshold Criteria (CIOMS Working Groups 1999). No sentinel cases were found. The only positive rechallenge case did not report critical information to allow medical assessment. Of 11 cases reporting dechallenge information, 6 reported negative dechallenge (e.g., thrombocytopenia did not resolve after abiraterone acetate therapy was withdrawn) and the rest recovered with platelet transfusion or reported insufficient information.


In summary, risk factors (such as concomitant medication, concurrent condition, or medical history) or insufficient information confounded case assessment of a clear relationship between thrombocytopenia and abiraterone acetate therapy in all 71 cases. The most frequently reported relevant concurrent medical conditions were disease progression and bone marrow metastases/cancer/infiltration thrombocytopenia.
 



Conclusion

Abiraterone acetate is indicated for the treatment of patients with castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer. Thrombocytopenia due to metastatic bone marrow involvement and DIC is not uncommon in this disease stage. In addition, many other concomitant medical conditions and concurrent medications used in this patient population may also cause thrombocytopenia. These factors limit the ability to identify thrombocytopenia as an adverse effect of abiraterone acetate. Based on the review of the Company safety database, thrombocytopenia is not considered associated with the use of abiraterone acetate. Key factors supporting this conclusion include the available data on rechallenge, dechallenge, and plausible latency cases, all of which reported concomitant medication or concurrent medical conditions, including but not limited to disease progression and bone metastases that confounded the case assessment. In addition, analysis of data from 2 double-blind controlled studies demonstrated a similar incidence of thrombocytopenia between subjects treated with abiraterone acetate and placebo that was lower with abiraterone acetate treatment once adjusted for exposure duration. Based on all of the available safety data, thrombocytopenia is not associated with the use of abiraterone acetate.

Abiraterone has been approved since 2011 in combination with prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Abiraterone is an inhibitor of the enzyme 17a-hydroxylase/C17,20-lyase (CYP17), which catalyses the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone into testosterone precursors (dihydroepiandrosterone, DHEA, and androstenedione) in testicular, adrenal and prostatic tumour tissues.

Thrombocytopenia (or decreased platelet count) is not listed in the product information for abiraterone. No case reports for thrombocytopenia during or after abiraterone treatment were found published. Thrombocytopenia with the use of abiraterone is mentioned as occurring in two patients out of 39 in an observational study of the compassionate use of this drug.

From September 2011 up to April 16th 2013, 26 Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) with the combination abiraterone and thrombocytopenia were retrieved from the WHO Global ICSR Database, VigiBaseâ„¢. In spite of the very complex clinical condition (metastatic prostate cancer) and the scarcity of data in many reports, the analysis of these 25 cases (after removal of one duplicate) from VigiBase would suggest that abiraterone may decrease platelet count, possibly through the platelet production process.""" ;
