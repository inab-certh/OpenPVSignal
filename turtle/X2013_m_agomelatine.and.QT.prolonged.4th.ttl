                         OpenPVSignal:has_content """Drug-induced LQTS can be caused by cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular drugs. The cardiovascular side effects of older antidepressants, such as tricyclic anti-depressants, are well established and are known to be linked to their capacity to inhibit cardiac and vascular ion channels. Other newer antidepressant agents, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mirtazapine and venlafaxine, also share antagonistic proper- ties with regard to voltage- dependent ion channels in different tissues.13 Agomelatine, similarly to mianserin and mirtazapine, has a serotonin 5-HT2C antagonist effect.1,3,4 Both mianserin and mirtazapine can prolong the QTc interval.16,17,18
Drug-induced LQTS results from the association of predisposing factors to a drug acting as an environmental stressor. Predisposing factors include female sex, congenital LQTS, electrolyte disturbances and high drug levels.
In the reviewed ICSRs, exposure to normal doses of agomelatine was the only suspected cause of QTc prolongation in two patients with congenital LQTS. Overdose of agomelatine was reported as the only suspected cause of QT prolongation in patients with multiple drug intentional overdoses. All patients were on previous therapy with other agents. The role of concomitant medication and risk factors is discussed below:
In case 0 (likely a duplicate of case 2), agomelatine was prescribed to a 58 year old female patient treated with fentanyl and ramipril; a causal link is supported by time to onset, (17 days), risk factors, and reversibility of the adverse reaction. Case 2 (from literature) reports that agomelatine was prescribed to a 58 year old female patient on treatment with venlafaxine, ramipril and fentanyl. Both antidepressants, venlafaxine and agomelatine, were reported as suspected to cause the QTc prolongation. For concomitant drugs, no other pharmacodynamic interactions seem to be likely, and fentanyl, an opiod agent, has also been suggested to have neutral or even some protective effect against QTc prolongation. The patient started therapy with venlafaxine and a borderline QTc interval prolongation was diagnosed. Increased doses did not worsen the effect on QT, and QTc was normalized on venlafaxine 75 mg. Venlafaxine was later stopped because of lack of effect.
Agomelatine was first started, concomitantly with venlafaxine, at 25 mg and after 10 days augmen- ted to 50 mg. QTc interval prolongation was found 17 days after initiation of agomelatine therapy and seven days after the dose change to 50 mg. It increased to 477 milliseconds at day 31 (day 21 of 50 mg dosage). The dose of agomelatine was reduced and the QTc inter- val prolongation normalized seven days after the dose reduction.
The dose effect on QTc interval supports a causal relationship. It is unclear whether the effect could be caused by both agents in a synergistic manner when administered concomitantly, but the reaction did remain under agomelatine therapy when venlafaxine had been already stopped.
In case 1, agomelatine was administered to a female patient with congenital LQTS treated with bisoprolol. The time to onset (eight days) and the underlying condition support a causal relationship with agomelatine.
In case 3, a female patient died after the introduction of an antidepressant therapy with low dose escitalopram and 25 mg of agomelatine added to her previous long term medication with lanzoprazole and hydrochlorothiazide/irbesartan. A review found that escitalopram has a small effect on the QTc interval and a prolonged QTc was seen in 2 to 14% of escitalopram overdose cases, without serious cardiac sequelae.19 In this ICSR, in addition to the suspected co-administered escitalopram, female gender and hypothetical (but not reported) electrolyte disturbances (possibly caused by hydrochlorothiazide and vomiting) are risk factors for QT prolongation, and may have played a role in the fatal outcome. Concerning pharmacokinetic interactions, lanzoprazole as well as all proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) may inhibit CYP2C19 which metabolizes escitalopram20 (together with CYP2D6) and also plays a minor role in agomelatine’s metabolism.1,2,3,4 Irbesartan has a modest affinity for CYP1A2, suggesting that the theoretical potential for drug interactions is likely to be quite low for the main CYP metabolizing agomelatine, but it has been shown to inhibit tolbutamide methylhydroxylation more potently, suggesting that it could play a role in inhibiting CYP2C9 agomelatine metabolism.
It has been observed that patients can present different responses to diverse QT-prolonging drugs.21 In case 4, agomelatine was given to a patient treated with ami- sulpride for psychoaffective disorder and with meto- prolol for congenital LQTS. Treatment with ami- sulpride dated from the previous year (2010), and QT prolongation was reported as caused by agomelatine only. In case 8, where quetiapine 600 mg was added to agomelatine, it cannot be ruled out that agomelatine played some role in the QT prolongation.
Concerning cases reporting intentional overdose, the possible causality of agomelatine overdose is confounded by concomitant ingestion of other agents known to be QT prolonging. In case 5, chlorprothixene (also overdosed) and prothipendyl can both cause QT prolongation, therefore an additive effect is likely; as well as in the other two cases, where both patients also ingested other agents known to be QT prolonging (3000 mg of trimipramine in case 6 and an unspecified dose of ziprasidone in case 7). In spite of this confounding, due to overdoses of agomelatine, the role played by agomelatine cannot be ruled out.
The analysis of these ICSRs suggests that agomelatine might prolong the QT interval in patients with predisposing risk factors or overdose.

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content """Agomelatine is a synthetic analogue of the hormone melatonin that regulates various circadian rhythms including sleep-wake cycles. It is used as an anti- depressant with a novel mechanism of action. It acts as a potent melatonin receptor agonist drug (MT1 and MT2), and similarly to currently used antidepressant drugs, mianserin and mirtazapine, it also binds to and inhibits
5-HT2C receptor subtypes. Agomelatine was approved by centralized procedure as an antidepressant agent in the EU in February 2009, and in Australia late 2010; it has not been approved in the USA to date.1,2,3,4
In in vitro assays, CYP1A2 was responsible for the major metabolism of agomelatine, whereas CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 were found likely to be of potential relevance only at higher agomelatine concentrations. The concomitant use of potent CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g. fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) is contraindicated.
The prolongation of cardiac repolarization in Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is reflected in the surface electro- cardiogram, expressed as the QT interval corrected by the heart rate (QTc).5 QT lengthening can result from several factors: some medications, congenital LQTS, clinically significant bradycardia or heart disease, electrolyte imbalance (hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia or hypocalcaemia), and/or pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic interactions.6,7,8 Long QTc can lead to a life-threatening polymorphic ventricular tachycardia known as Torsade de Pointes (TdP) that may cause sudden death, but this relationship is not always straightforward.8
Long QTc can be congenital or acquired. Drug therapy is the most common cause of the acquired Long QT Syndrome (aLQTS). Virtually all drugs that cause aLQTS reduce the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) and prolong the cardiac action potential; case series support the idea that genetic variants in ion channels can increase the risk.8 Some drugs prolong QTc in a dose- dependent manner; others do so at any dose.
Most patients that develop drug-induced TdP have underlying risk factors. Female sex is the most common.
The most common class of drugs implicated in aLQTS is QT prolonging anti-arrhythmic drugs; in particular IKr blockers such as sotalol, dofetilide, quinidine and ibutilide, but this proarrhythmia can also occur with non-cardiovascular drugs, especially antipsychotics and antidepressants.8,9,10,11,12,13
The effects of agomelatine on QT interval were evaluated in two specific premarketing studies. The first study included only 13 subjects and agomelatine did not seem to cause any clinically meaningful changes in cardiac depolarization. The second study was conducted in response to regulatory requirements and included 56 subjects (28 males and 28 females). The results showed that single doses of agomelatine 50 mg and 400 mg fulfilled the demands set out in the CHMP/ICH/2/04 “Note for guidance on the clinical evaluation of QT/ QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential for non-antiarrhythmic drugs”.2,4

                   OpenPVSignal:has_content """Up to 25 January 2013, a total of nine Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) of agomelatine and QT prolonged were submitted to the WHO Global ICSR Database, VigiBaseTM. The IC value for the combination was 2.38 and the IC025 1.29. An overview of these case reports’ main characteristics is displayed in Table 1. All ICSRs are from Europe, most come from Germany (seven out of nine, including one report from literature), one from Italy and one from Spain. The ICSRs were entered into VigiBase from July 2010 to April 2012.
The reporters are physicians, except for one from literature and one from a consumer. Case 2 and case 0 (from a German physician) seem to be duplicates. The case has also been published in a review, which provides more precise and thoroughly documented data. Due to this we will consider only eight cases. Seven out of eight cases concerned female patients and there was one male patient. There was only one patient older than 60 years (a 76 year old woman), the male patient was 28 years old and the other patients were aged in the range 32-58 years.
The 76 year old woman died after 16 days of concomitant therapy of escitalopram and agomelatine at lowest doses. Both drugs had been added to non psychotropic therapy (irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and lanzoprazole) and had been administered for 14 days, when QT prolongation was diagnosed. In five of eight cases the patients recovered from QT prolongation.
All eight cases mentioned concomitant drugs. Two patients had a medical history of congenital LQTS, and both were on beta-blocker therapy (bisoprolol and metoprolol respectively). Although seven cases reported concomitant administration of other drugs associated with QT prolongation, agomelatine was the only suspected medication in four cases. Concomitant medication included psychotropic drugs in seven cases. No ICSRs mentioned any antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, antiemetic, antineoplastic or any other non psychotropic drugs previously known to cause QT prolongation as concomitant medication.
Agomelatine was added to previous non psychotropic therapy in three cases. In case 1, agomelatine was added as the only psychotropic medication eight days prior to the reaction. In the other two cases agomelatine was added in combination with another psychotropic agent to previous non psychotropic therapy. In case 3 (time to onset: eight days), agomelatine was prescribed together with escitalopram to a female patient on previous therapy not associated with QT prolongation. In case 5, agomelatine 25 mg was prescribed on an unspecified date; the patient ingested a massive dose of agomelatine together with two antipsychotics, chlorprothixene and prothipendyl, in a suicide attempt the day before the adverse reaction was detected.
Agomelatine was added to previous therapy with agents known/reported as potential QT-prolonging agents in two cases. In case 2 (report from the literature), agomelatine was prescribed to a patient on previous therapy with venlafaxine,
together with a fentanyl and ramipril long-term therapy. In case 4, agomelatine was prescribed to a patient with congenital LQTS on previous therapy with amisulpride and metoprolol. On the other hand, in case 8, quetiapine 600 mg was prescribed to a female patient on long-term therapy with agomelatine (nine months).
Seven cases reported concomitant psychotropic therapy with antidepressants or antipsychotics. In three of the seven cases agomelatine was the only suspected drug, although administered concomitantly with amisulpride, chlorprothixene, prothipendyl and trimipramine. References from the literature and product information report QT prolongation in association with venlafaxine, escitalopram, amisulpride, chlorprothixene, prothipendyl, trimipramine, ziprasidone and quetiapine.11
There are three cases reporting overdose (two reported as intentional overdose, one of them also states suicide attempt, the third is reported with the MedDRA term multiple drug overdose). Case 5, a 28 year old male patient, attempted suicide by taking one packet of acetylsalicylic acid, 30 tablets of chlorprothixene, pro- thipendyl and one packet of agomelatine (700 mg) in one day; previous concomitant administration of diclofenac is mentioned. Case 7, a 32 year old woman, ingested unspecified overdoses of psychotropic medicines (agomelatine, ziprasidone, pregabalin, lamotrigine, venlafaxine) together with ibuprofen, and all medicines were reported as suspected. In case 6, the patient ingested 90 mg of lorazepam, 150 mg of zopiclone, 3000 mg of trimipramine and 350 mg of agomelatine. All three patients recovered from QT prolongation, two patients recovered after one day, and one patient recovered after two days. Although all three patients took other drugs that have previously been associated with QT prolongation, agomelatine was reported as the only suspected drug in two cases (cases 5 and 6).

Agomelatine has no binding interaction with the hERG potassium channels, whose inhibition can lead to prolonged QT interval. Based on these in vitro results, it seems unlikely that agomelatine could prolong QT intervals.
During the agomelatine development program, two specific studies were performed to evaluate cardiovascular safety in healthy volunteers. The first was a cross-over randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study in 13 volunteers, exposed to single dose of 100 and 200mg of agomelatine, versus placebo. The administration of 100 or 200mg of agomelatine did not significantly prolong the ventricular repolarisation time.
The second (“thorough QT/QTc study”), was carried out according to the ICH E14 Guideline. It was a cross-over randomized study in 56 healthy young volunteers (28 males and 28 females) exposed to single oral maximal therapeutic (50mg) and supra-therapeutic (400mg) doses of agomelatine, placebo and single oral 400mg dose of moxifloxacin (positive control). The absence of effect on QT/QTc interval observed in the first study was confirmed in the second, even at supra- therapeutic dose up to 400mg of agomelatine.
From Market Authorisation (19-FEB-2009) to 19- FEB-2013 (PSUR 6 data-lock point), 11 cases of Electrocardiogram QT prolonged and 1 case of Long QT syndrome were reported to the MAH, i.e. a reported incidence of 1.4 case / 100 000 patient- years.
Out of these 12 cases, 6 occurred in a context of over- dose:
•	5 occurred in a multiple drug overdose, with a drug likely to induce of favor a conduction disorder concomitantly taken with agomelatine (trimipramine twice, bupropion, chlorprothixene and venlafaxine).
•	1 case occurred in association with severe alcohol poisoning.
In these cases, the suspected amount of agomelatine varied from 350mg to 3500mg. In the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of agomelatine, a case of ingestion of 2450mg without subsequent cardiovascular abnormalities was reported.
These 6 cases represented 4.2% of the 142 cases of agomelatine overdose received since Market Authorisation (68 cases of agomelatine overdose and 74 cases of multiple drug overdoses). No cardiac safety concern raised from the analysis of the 136 other cases of agomelatine overdose.
The remaining 6 cases of prolonged QT not occurring in a context of drug overdose are as follows:
 


•	Medical history/context:
-	2 cases in patients with medical history of congenital / Long QT syndrome
-	1 case in a patient concomitantly treated with Quetiapine, for which prolonged QT is listed.
-	1 case in an elderly patient, in a context of diabetic hyperosmolar coma
-	2 cases (1 case in a context of atrioventricular node ablation, in a patient treated with amiodarone) were poorly documented (e.g. missing ECGs). The role of agomelatine was subsequently difficult to assess.

•	3 cases of positive dechallenge were observed, with no case of positive or negative rechallenge.
•	Outcome: 3 patients recovered, 3 were not recovered at the time of the report
These 6 cases were reviewed by Prof. Christian Funck-Brentano, independent Cardiologist and Clinical Pharmacologist. Out of these 6 cases, 3 were assessed as not related to agomelatine:
•	In 1 case, the patient was concomitantly treated with amisulpride, a drug known to prolong QT and cause Torsades de Pointes
•	In 1 case, the patient was concomitantly treated with quetiapine, a drug known to prolong QT/ QTc by 5 to 15 ms
•	In 1 case, there was in fact no clinically significant QTc change, using the Fridericia correction formula, a formula which is widely accepted as limiting the biases introduced by the Bazett formula
Two poorly documented cases were considered as not assessable.
In the remaining case, no document is available in support of the diagnosis of QT prolongation (heart rate, corrected QT not provided): the patient presented with hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome. Severe potassium deficit often occurs in hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state and, although no indication is given in the report on kalemia, it is likely that QT prolongation, if any, was due to hypokalemia. The presumed cause of the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic coma was not indicated and could have multiple origins.
Overall, the role of agomelatine in these 12 cases seems to be unlikely. Based on the current clinical data and review of cases received from postmarketing surveillance, QT prolonged was not considered as a signal for agomelatine. This event will remain under close monitoring.

QT prolongation is a proarrhythmic cardiac repolarization disturbance that can be congenital or induced by stressors, especially several drugs. Many drugs including antiarrhythmic agents, antipsychotics and antidepressants have been associated with QT prolongation.
On 25 January 2013, there were nine Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) reporting the combination between agomelatine and QT prolonged in the WHO Global ICSR Database, VigiBase™. This possible association is not listed in the product information for agomelatine and only one published case report was found in a literature search. The ICSRs from VigiBase present cases in which agomelatine has been suspected as the cause of QT prolongation in patients with risk factors (female gender, congenital Long QT Syndrome), co- administration of other agents previously associated with QT prolongation, or intentional overdose. The analysis of these case reports suggests that agomelatine might prolong the QT interval in patients with predisposing risk factors or overdose.""" ;

Case 2 (from literature) reports that  agomelatine was prescribed to a 58 year old  female patient on treatment with venlafaxine,  ramipril and fentanyl. Both antidepressants,  venlafaxine and agomelatine, were reported as  suspected to cause the QTc prolongation. For  concomitant drugs, no other pharmacodynamic  interactions seem to be likely, and fentanyl, an  opiod agent, has also been suggested to have  neutral or even some protective effect against QTc  prolongation. The patient started therapy with  venlafaxine and a borderline QTc interval  prolongation was diagnosed. Increased doses did  not worsen the effect on QT, and QTc was  normalized on venlafaxine 75 mg. Venlafaxine was  later stopped because of lack of effect.  Agomelatine was first started, concomitantly with  venlafaxine, at 25 mg and after 10 days augmented to 50 mg. QTc interval prolongation was found  17 days after initiation of agomelatine therapy and seven days after the dose change to 50 mg. It  increased to 477 milliseconds at day 31 (day 21 of  50 mg dosage). The dose of agomelatine was  reduced and the QTc inter- val prolongation  normalized seven days after the dose reduction.  The dose effect on QTc interval supports a causal  relationship. It is unclear whether the effect could  be caused by both agents in a synergistic manner  when administered concomitantly, but the reaction  did remain under agomelatine therapy when  venlafaxine had been already stopped." ;
