                   OpenPVSignal:has_content """This relatively small series of cases reporting a suspected association between golimumab and the occurrence of meningitis have been observed in several countries and in all ICSRs the anti-TNF antibody was reported as the only suspected drug. Golimumab was generally reported to be used for a licensed indication and at the recommended dosage. An alternative product or combination of products that might explain the occurrence of the suspected reaction was not readily identified from the ICSRs. The positive IC and IC025 values showed that the meningitis-golimumab association has been statistically disproportionately reported into the database. 
Although clinical experience with this product is limited, golimumab is considered to have a relatively similar safety profile and to offer a similar benefit/risk ratio compared to other anti-TNF products.4,5 Meningitis is not commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis or spondyloarthropathies; however, it has been reported in association with various anti-TNF drugs used to treat such disorders including infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept. ICSRs of meningitis from various types of infectious origin have been observed in association with both infliximab and etanercept therapy.7-12 Interestingly, cases of meningitis of non-infectious origin have also been reported.13 Since golimumab is similar in structure to infliximab, it has been suggested that a comparable pattern of opportunistic infections could be expected with it after further clinical use.14 Since half of the cases in the series of ICSRs with golimumab were reported as viral meningitis, it would be interesting to know if golimumab could represent a particular risk for this type of adverse reaction. As far as we know, the association has not been previously reported in the literature and the risk of meningitis is not mentioned in the product labelling for golimumab. Opportunistic infections are well recognised adverse reactions of the anti-TNF class of drugs. Meningitis is a particularly serious and life threatening complication of several types of infectious diseases and is specifically mentioned in the product labelling of the other anti-TNF products. Current information supports a signal of meningitits in association with golimumab, and we recommend its inclusion in the product label.""" ;

TNF-a is an important mediator of articular inflammation, and elevated TNF-a levels in the blood, synovium, and joints have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Golimumab has been primarily licensed in many countries for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, as well as spondyloarthropathies such as psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.1,2,3 It has been licensed in some countries for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis with an inadequate response or intolerance to prior treatment, or when requiring continuous steroid therapy.3 Although clinical experience with golimumab is somewhat limited, after direct and indirect comparisons on efficacy and safety, some authors have concluded that infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab offer similar benefit/risk ratios and could be regarded as equivalent treatment alternatives in psoriatic arthritis.4 However, because of the paucity of data available, similar types of adverse events as those seen with other TNF-a inhibitors, need to be considered as of special concern for patients treated with golimumab therapy.5 We discuss here a series of eight Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) on the association of golimumab and meningitis that have been reported from five different countries to the WHO Global ICSR Database, VigiBase™." ;

The subjects, six females and two males, were between 36 and 64 years of age. The reaction was further described as viral meningitis in four cases and aseptic meningitis in one case, with no additional description in the three other cases. There were no fatalities but in four cases the outcome of the reaction was unknown or not reported. Golimumab was the only suspected medicine in all the ICSRs and was used subcutaneously, mainly 50 mg once a month, to treat arthritis (three reports), ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, and immune system disorder (in one case each). The indication for use was not reported in two cases, and there was almost no information on the length of the therapy or the reaction onset. There was only one rechallenge reported in the ICSRs, and the effect of this was unknown. Four of the case reports were reported by a physician or other health care professionals. The IC and the IC025 values for the association were 1.53 and 0.36 respectively." ;

The drug was approved as late as in 2009. We discuss a series of eight Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) on the association of golimumab and meningitis that have been received from five different countries to the WHO Global ICSR Database, VigiBaseTM. The association has been statistically disproportionately reported into the database. Although rare, the occurrence of meningitis has already been reported in association with the other anti-TNF products in the class. Current information supports a signal of meningitits in association with golimumab, and we recommend its inclusion in the product label." ;
