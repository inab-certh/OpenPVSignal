They could be accounted for by the ubiquitous distribution of PDE4 isoforms across many tissues. The most worrying potential toxicity generic to such PDE4 inhibitors could be arteritis. In recent human clinical trials with some PDE4 inhibitors the main reason for drop-outs was an incidence of colitis, raising the possibility that it was secondary to arteritis. In clinical trials with cilomilast, another PDE4 inhibitor, GI adverse effects including melaena did occur and were monitored with colonoscopy. Although the findings did not establish a relationship between melaena and vasculitis, the FDA concluded, from the low number of cases, that there was insufficient evidence to rule it out in humans.10" ;

It is worth starting the assessment with the three cases describing clinical trial patients, in which the reporting physicians classified the melaena as not related to roflumilast treatment. If the casual relationship between roflumilast administration and melaena could be completely ruled out in these three cases, the remaining three cases might not generate a signal.
According to the narrative in ICSR 2, the patient went to the outpatient clinic 19 days after the first dose of roflumilast because of bowel movement difficulties (constipation and delayed gastric emptying are accepted ADRs of roflumilast3). The patient had also experienced, among other symptoms, blood in stool with known haemorrhoids two days after the first dose of roflumilast. When roflumilast treatment was discontinued the symptoms stopped. When roflumilast was resumed intermittently, the symptoms re-appeared. According to the reporter, the concurrent haemorrhoids provided a more plausible alternative explanation for the occurrence of blood in the stool than roflumilast treatment. However, this conclusion requires closer scrutiny. The original reported term used by the investigator was \"faecal occult blood (FOB) with known haemorrhoids\". FOB means small amounts of blood, not visible to the eye, in the stool indicating that bleeding has occurred somewhere in the upper or lower GI tract.11 In this case it might have been caused by the mild proctitis (inflammation of the rectum) that was also reported. The reporting physician pointed out that FOB might be a sign of the proctitis (i.e. haematochezia and not melaena); however, it would not explain why the patient, after discontinuation of the therapy \"had recovered\" and then, when roflumilast was later resumed, the symptoms re-appeared. Roflumilast is known to cause constipation and delayed gastric emptying (so possibly also has a more global effect on gut motility). Haemorrhoids are exacerbated by constipation, and the patient has a past history of haemorrhoids. However, there is no mention of haemorrhoids in the examination findings but a colonoscopy revealed proctitis. The patient reported blood in the stool only two days after the first dose of roflumilast, which may be too soon for the drug to have caused constipation. The proctitis appears to be a more plausible explanation for the visible blood in the stool, but it is not clear that the roflumilast caused the proctitis.
In ICSR 3 the patient, treated concomitantly with phenprocoumon, started roflumilast therapy on 23 February. On 17 May he was admitted to hospital and reported having had melaena for approximately four weeks. He also had a medical history of chronic gastritis. Roflumilast (and perhaps phenprocoumon) therapy was discontinued on 17 May. Gastroscopy did not reveal a source of haemorrhage in the upper GI tract. The patient was diagnosed with diverticulosis and a solitary polyp in the ascending colon. Phenprocoumon therapy was then reintroduced (there are no exact dates in the report, but it seems to have occurred earlier than the reintroduction of roflumilast). Roflumilast was resumed on 2 June but was discontinued on 17 October at the patient's request. According to the reporting physician, other plausible explanations, such as phenprocoumon therapy and undiagnosed GI haemorrhage, make a causal relationship between roflumilast treatment and melaena unlikely. However, roflumilast may have been responsible for the gastritis or have exacerbated it, which could have led to the mentioned GI haemorrhage (causing melaena). If this were the case, phenprocoumon may have made the symptoms worse.
The patient in ICSR 4 developed duodenal ulcers, erosive antral gastritis, upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage and tarry stool approximately two months after the first dose of roflumilast.
Roflumilast was discontinued and the patient recovered. The symptoms then re-occurred upon re-challenge. The sender commented on the case that, in the absence of any pharmacological indication that roflumilast could favour the occurrence of the patient's symptoms, the concurrent erosive antral gastritis provided a more plausible explanation. However, as described above, the literature states that PDE inhibitors are expected to increase gastric acid secretion (which may lead to other GI disturbances). Thus, there may be a plausible pharmacological explanation, and the causality chain, gastritis â duodenal ulcer
â GI haemorrhage â melaena, is at least not impossible.
One could summarise the analysis of the three clinical trial reports by saying that there is no convincing evidence for the causal relationship between roflumilast treatment and melaena. However, if there is a pharmacologically plausible explanation for a causal relationship between a medicine and an event, the fact that other plausible explanations may also exist is not enough to rule out the possibility of an ADR completely.
Tiptropium may cause blood in faeces from the lower GI tract. Although the patient in ICSR 1 was treated with tiotropium, the reporter, a physician, was unlikely to have confused melaena with haematochezia. It is worth noting that the reporter in ICSR 7 was not a health care professional, and bleeding from the lower GI tract in this case might have been mistaken for melaena.
Because of the confounding concomitant medication (tiotropium, acetylsalicylic acid and warfarin), ICSR 6 provides no convincing evidence of a causal relationship.
If one assesses the issue in a narrower context,
i.e. whether a causal relationship between roflumilast administration and melaena can be established solely on the basis of the reports, the result would be controversial. Four patients of the assessed six (ICSRs 2, 3, 4 and 6) suffered from illnesses (proctitis, GI neoplasm, duodenal ulcer) and/or were treated with anticoagulant drugs that could also account for the melaena.
On the other hand, if one assesses the possible relationship between a group of possibly interrelated GI adverse effects assuming that their single root cause can be the administration of roflumilast (or, in general, of PDE inhibitors) and their possible manifestations including melaena, the causality is plausible. It has been shown previously that GI adverse effects of PDE inhibitors have been suspected with various mechanisms for decades.4,5,10 These mechanisms, increased gastric acid production (described as \"possibly related to the class of the compound\" by the CHMP) and/or arteritis, may lead to manifestations of the various GI reactions reported (duodenal ulcer, gastritis, diverticulosis etc.); with consequent, melaena particularly in sensitive patients (for example when treated with anticoagulants). The fact that the GI manifestations have been reported as adverse effects and not as concomitant sicknesses in all cases, seem to support this explanation.
It is almost a philosophical question that, if the above analysis is true, what should be called \"the\" adverse reaction; the increased gastric acid production and/or its possible sequel: the gastric ulcer, and/or its plausible consequence: the intestinal haemorrhage, and/or its symptom: the melaena?
One possible answer is that, since patients are now being encouraged to report their drug adverse effects; listing of those symptoms that may be easily self-diagnosed may be advocated.

These effects were possibly related to the class of PDE4 inhibitors.3 Indeed, such effects of PDE inhibitors have been known for over forty years. For instance, Harris et al. described stimulation of hydrochloric acid production by methylxanthines in the isolated frog gastric mucosa by inhibition of PDE that destroys cAMP.4 Scratcherd et al. found proof that methylxanthines can both initiate gastric secretion and potentiate histaminic- stimulated gastric secretion.5 Moreover, according to CHMP, morphological changes in the GI tract (erosion and ulceration) were seen in both rats and monkeys in higher doses.3 Such changes were not normally expected at therapeutic doses in humans, yet the approved European Summary of Product Characteristics contains, in addition to the adverse reactions gastritis (uncommon, i.e.
>1/1,000 - <1/100) and constipation (rare, i.e.
>1/10,000 -<1/1,000), haematochezia as a rare ADR.6
Assessing the concomitant medication in the reports in Table 1, it is evident that all reported patients took either blood anticoagulants (discussed above) or another drug that might have caused blood in the stool. Tiotropium may cause constipation and intestinal obstruction, which may lead to hard and bloody stools.7 Similarly, known ADRs of azithromycin are bloody diarrhoea and constipation.8 Constipation may also lead to haemorrhoids (swollen veins in the rectum).9 However, blood in the stool formed this way can better be classified as haematochezia than melaena.
Returning to the potential GI class adverse effects of PDE4 inhibitors, a somewhat different explanation was offered recently. It was pointed out that for second-generation PDE4 inhibitors, including roflumilast, GI disturbances were the most prevalent adverse drug reactions (ADRs).
They could be accounted for by the ubiquitous distribution of PDE4 isoforms across many tissues. The most worrying potential toxicity generic to such PDE4 inhibitors could be arteritis. In recent human clinical trials with some PDE4 inhibitors the main reason for drop-outs was an incidence of colitis, raising the possibility that it was secondary to arteritis. In clinical trials with cilomilast, another PDE4 inhibitor, GI adverse effects including melaena did occur and were monitored with colonoscopy. Although the findings did not establish a relationship between melaena and vasculitis, the FDA concluded, from the low number of cases, that there was insufficient evidence to rule it out in humans.10""" ;

COPD patients have been shown to have an increased incidence of gastroduodenal erosions and ulcers (Fukumura et al. 1992).
Epidemiological studies show an increased risk of upper GI bleeding amongst COPD patients who are not exposed to roflumilast with an almost two-fold risk compared to controls [HR:1.93, 95% CI:1.73- 2.17] (Huang et al. 2012). Although the primary etiology of these erosions/ulcers is the hypersecretion of gastric acid induced by hypoxemia or hypercapnia, additional risk factors include advanced age, male gender, smoking history, comorbidities of heart failure, chronic renal disease, hypertension, diabetes, and the use of ulcerogenic medications.
Roflumilast, a selective phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitor indicated for severe COPD, was first approved in 2010 and is now marketed in 43 countries. Through 2012, exposure is estimated at 286,000 patient-years. A search of the roflumilast global safety database identified 5 cases of \"melaena\", 4 of which are medically-confirmed.
Events occurred in patients aged 60-80 years with latencies between 4 days and 4 months with no clear pattern. Reports of these events present confounding factors that could account for the melaena, including co-morbid conditions (e.g.; duodenal ulcer, gastritis, proctitis, heart failure), a previous history of gastrointestinal bleeding, and/or co-suspect medications (e.g., anticoagulants, ASA, azithromycin).
Statistical signal detection efforts using the Empirica Signal tool, with data from VigiBaseâ¢ and AERS, did not identify a statistical signal (EB05 >2) for \"melaena\" or any of the preferred terms that comprise the GI haemorrhage SMQ.
Rates of upper GI AEs associated with haemorrhage, including \"melaena\", from the COPD clinical development program were infrequent and slightly lower in roflumilast than in placebo.
15/6,563 COPD subjects exposed to roflumilast (0.23%) reported terms indicative of upper GI haemorrhage compared to 18/5, 491 placebo- treated subjects (0.33%). \"Melaena\", specifically, was reported in 2 subjects in each arm with roflumilast (0.03%) and placebo (0.04%).
Systematic hemoccult testing, conducted in five placebo-controlled studies with roflumilast, and follow-up gastrointestinal investigations (colonoscopy) to detect GI bleeding, revealed no difference from placebo.
Biologically, while first generation PDE4 inhibitors were reported to increase acid secretion due to gastric parietal cell stimulation, less activity is expected with later-generation inhibitors, including roflumilast, due to lower-affinity binding at the rolipram binding site in the gastric glands. Indeed, cilomilast revealed improved GI tolerability and, in
 


phase 1 studies, had no effect on gastric pH in healthy subjects (Houghton et al. 2006). Subacute and chronic toxicity studies of roflumilast in mice, hamsters, and dogs revealed no histological changes in the glandular stomach or intestine suggestive of GI toxicity. GI changes were seen in rats and monkeys at doses 50- to 200- times above the clinical dose of 500 [ig/day. These data demonstrated that roflumilast, at therapeutic doses, is unlikely to significantly stimulate acid secretion or produce GI bleeding.

Conclusion
The available evidence does not suggest a causal relationship between the occurrence of melaena and the use of roflumilast. Upper GI haemorrhage is known to be increased in the COPD population. The cases of melaena identified (5 cases out of 286,000 patient-years of exposure) are confounded and occur at a rate which is anticipated in a COPD population. Additionally, evidence from pre-clinical and controlled clinical studies does not support an association.
Nevertheless, the MAHs are committed to the close monitoring of AE reports of melaena through their routine pharmacovigilance processes.

From November 2010 to January 2013, seven Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) of melaena in association with roflumilast were entered into the WHO Global ICSR Database, VigiBaseâ¢, raising the possibility of a causal relationship.
Although melaena in some of these cases could have been caused by the patients' concomitant conditions (e.g. gastrointestinal neoplasm, duodenal ulcer, and proctitis) or their concurrent medication (e.g. anticoagulant drugs), a causal relationship cannot be ruled out. It is known that phosphodiesterase inhibitors, the group of drugs to which roflumilast belongs, may cause gastrointestinal disturbances (duodenal ulcer, colitis), and melaena is an easily diagnosable symptom of these adverse conditions.""" ;

The patient had also experienced, among other symptoms, blood in stool with known haemorrhoids two days after the first dose of roflumilast. When roflumilast treatment was discontinued the symptoms stopped. When roflumilast was resumed intermittently, the symptoms re-appeared. According to the reporter, the concurrent haemorrhoids provided a more plausible alternative explanation for the occurrence of blood in the stool than roflumilast treatment. However, this conclusion requires closer scrutiny. The original reported term used by the investigator was \"faecal occult blood (FOB) with known haemorrhoids\". FOB means small amounts of blood, not visible to the eye, in the stool indicating that bleeding has occurred somewhere in the upper or lower GI tract.11 In this case it might have been caused by the mild proctitis (inflammation of the rectum) that was also reported. The reporting physician pointed out that FOB might be a sign of the proctitis (i.e. haematochezia and not melaena); however, it would not explain why the patient, after discontinuation of the therapy \"had recovered\" and then, when roflumilast was later resumed, the symptoms re-appeared. Roflumilast is known to cause constipation and delayed gastric emptying (so possibly also has a more global effect on gut motility). Haemorrhoids are exacerbated by constipation, and the patient has a past history of haemorrhoids. However, there is no mention of haemorrhoids in the examination findings but a colonoscopy revealed proctitis. The patient reported blood in the stool only two days after the first dose of roflumilast, which may be too soon for the drug to have caused constipation. The proctitis appears to be a more plausible explanation for the visible blood in the stool, but it is not clear that the roflumilast caused the proctitis" ;

On 17 May he was admitted to hospital and reported having had melaena for approximately four weeks. He also had a medical history of chronic gastritis. Roflumilast (and perhaps phenprocoumon) therapy was discontinued on 17 May. Gastroscopy did not reveal a source of haemorrhage in the upper GI tract. The patient was diagnosed with diverticulosis and a solitary polyp in the ascending colon. Phenprocoumon therapy was then reintroduced (there are no exact dates in the report, but it seems to have occurred earlier than the reintroduction of roflumilast). Roflumilast was resumed on 2 June but was discontinued on 17 October at the patient's request. According to the reporting physician, other plausible explanations, such as phenprocoumon therapy and undiagnosed GI haemorrhage, make a causal relationship between roflumilast treatment and melaena unlikely. However, roflumilast may have been responsible for the gastritis or have exacerbated it, which could have led to the mentioned GI haemorrhage (causing melaena). If this were the case, phenprocoumon may have made the symptoms worse." ;

Roflumilast was discontinued and the patient recovered. The symptoms then re-occurred upon re-challenge. The sender commented on the case that, in the absence of any pharmacological indication that roflumilast could favour the occurrence of the patient's symptoms, the concurrent erosive antral gastritis provided a more plausible explanation. However, as described above, the literature states that PDE inhibitors are expected to increase gastric acid secretion (which may lead to other GI disturbances). Thus, there may be a plausible pharmacological explanation, and the causality chain, gastritis â duodenal ulcer
â GI haemorrhage â melaena, is at least not impossible.""" ;
