                         OpenPVSignal:has_content "Case reports in VigiBase are suggestive that there is a signal for the association of tapentadol and aggressive reaction. Tapentadol was the only drug suspected in 10 of the 12 cases. Time to onset was reported in three of the ICSRs and in each of those, onset occurred within two days of the initiation of tapentadol therapy, consistent with a drug-induced effect. Dechallenge is also suggestive of a signal. The outcome was stated in 10 ICSRs. The patients were reported as recovered or recovering in nine cases and not recovered in the other case. In eight of the cases where recovery was documented, the drug was reported to have been withdrawn as well as in the other report where the patient had not recovered. Three of the ICSRs describe serotonin syndrome and it is possible that aggressive reaction may be a component of serotonin syndrome. However, the absence of a concomitant serotonergic drug in two of these cases would make the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome uncertain. It is not surprising that neuropsychiatric effects may be associated with a drug such as tapentadol which combines both noradrenaline reuptake inhibition and mu-opioid receptor agonist activity. In addition, in the product information, psychiatric reactions such as anxiety, depressed mood, sleep disorder, nervousness and restlessness are described as common and disorientation, confusion, agitation, perception disturbances, abnormal dreams and euphoria are described as uncommon. The occurrence of aggressive reaction as an adverse reaction would not be inconsistent with these observations. In VigiBase, many psychiatric reactions have been reported for tapentadol. These include hallucinations (which are perception disturbances) (110 cases), confusion (which includes disorientation) (100 cases), agitation (which includes restlessness) (60 cases), depression including depression aggravated (51), anxiety (36), nervousness (22), sleep disorder (12), abnormal dreams (five) and euphoria (five). All of these terms are considered as common and uncommon in the product information and the presence of 12 ICSRs of aggressive reaction is consistent with the proposal that aggressive reaction is a signal." ;

It has 18 times less binding affinity than morphine to the human mu-opioid receptor but was only two-three times less potent in producing analgesia in animal models (on a dose per body weight basis). This low in vivo potency difference is consistent with its two mechanisms of action.
Tapentadol has been shown to inhibit noradrenaline reuptake in the brain of rats resulting in increased noradrenaline concentrations. In preclinical models, the analgesic activity due to the mu-opioid receptor agonist
 
activity of tapentadol can be antagonized by selective mu-opioid receptor antagonists (e.g., naloxone), whereas the noradrenaline reuptake inhibition is sensitive to noradrenaline modulators.1
Tapentadol is indicated for the management of moderate to severe chronic pain unresponsive to non- narcotic analgesia.1
Very common adverse reactions observed in clinical trials with tapentadol include gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and constipation and nervous system disorders such as dizziness, headache and somnolence. Common reactions include gastrointestinal effects such as vomiting, dry mouth and diarrhoea, nervous system disorders such as disturbance in attention, tremor and involuntary muscle contractions, psychiatric effects such as anxiety, depressed mood, sleep disorder, nervousness, restlessness, skin disorders such as pruritus and hyperhydrosis, fatigue, myalgia, vertigo, flushing and decreased appetite.1
Aggressive reaction, or aggression, is one of a number of ill-defined behaviour and socialisation disturbances. Aggression can be either proactive or reactive.2 Proactive aggression is goal-oriented requiring neither provocation nor anger. It can be directed towards possessing objects or dominating people. Reactive aggression involves angry outbursts in response to provocation.2 However, regardless of its psychiatric definition, an aggressive reaction is a clinical judgment.""" ;

The association has an IC value of 1.26 with an IC025 value of 0.33. The ICSRs were submitted from the United States (eight cases), Germany (two cases), Switzerland and the United Kingdom (one each). The patients ranged in age from 57 to 80 years with a median of 62 years in the seven cases which provided this information. The gender distribution was four females and seven males in the 11 cases with this information. Tapentadol was the only drug suspected in 10 of the 12 cases. Other drugs were taken in eight cases while concomitant drugs (not suspected) were reported in six cases and included drugs involved in a pain management setting such as paracetamol, tramadol, morphine and NSAIDs. This indicates a patient population with significant morbidity, also indicated by the use of antihypertensives, acetylsalicylic acid, antidiabetics, hypolipidaemics and antidepressants. Tapentadol was reported to have been administered orally, as expected, in 11 cases. The indication for use was included in 11 ICSRs and included treatment for pain in each case. Time to onset was reported in only three of the ICSRs and ranged from one to two days after the drug was administered. The outcome was stated in 10 ICSRs. The patients were reported as recovered or recovering in nine cases and not recovered in one case. In eight of the cases where recovery was documented, the drug was reported to have been withdrawn as well as in the other report where the patient had not recovered. Other reactions were described in all 12 ICSRs. In 10 of those ICSRs, other neuropsychiatric effects were described including confusion (four cases), hallucination, speech disorder (both three cases), agitation and increased sweating (both two cases). Interestingly, serotonin syndrome was reported in three cases and the aggressive reaction may have been a manifestation of serotonin syndrome. There is a precaution in the Australian Product Information concerning serotonin syndrome which notes that isolated cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported in association with tapentadol but a causal association has not been established.1 However, in the ICSRs reviewed here, only one of the cases in which serotonin syndrome has been reported documents the use of a serotonergic drug which might precipitate the occurrence of the syndrome. There is also another case (case 12) which lists three of the cardinal symptoms of serotonin syndrome but again, a concomitant serotonergic drug is not listed so an undiagnosed case of serotonin syndrome appears unlikely.3" ;

                OpenPVSignal:has_content "Tapentadol is a centrally acting synthetic analgesic combining opioid and non-opioid (noradrenaline reuptake inhibition) activity in a single molecule. In the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Database, VigiBaseTM, there are currently (25 January 2013) 12 ICSRs from four countries of aggressive reaction in association with tapentadol. The association has an IC value of 1.26 with an IC025 value of 0.33. The outcome was stated in 10 reports. The patients were reported as recovered or recovering in nine cases and not recovered in one case. The drug was reported to have been withdrawn in eight of the cases where recovery was documented, as well as in the ICSR where the patient had not recovered. The association of aggressive reaction with tapentadol appears to be a signal. Tapentadol was the only drug suspected in 10 of the 12 cases, the time to onset is suggestive of a drug-induced effect and the observation of recovery after dechallenge in eight of the 12 cases is highly supportive of the signal. In addition, the observation in the product information that other psychiatric reactions occurred commonly and uncommonly in clinical trials suggests that a mechanism for the development of another psychiatric reaction such as aggressive reaction may be possible. The fact that aggressive reaction has been reported in VigiBase at a similar level to some of these reactions is also suggestive of a signal." ;

Based on the integrated analysis including data from the clinical development program and post- marketing case reports for tapentadol and literature reports, there has not been sufficient evidence  for an association between tapentadol and aggressive reactions.

Clinical Experience
To date, only 0.03% subjects treated with tapentadol experienced aggression or anger during the clinical development program. All these events were non-serious, with mild or moderate intensity, and did not lead to a change of the safety profile of tapentadol.

Postmarketing Experience
A cumulative review of the MedDRA SMQ Hostility/ Aggression (narrow scope) in the MAHs’ safety databases was performed. Most of the retrieved cases contained the MedDRA Preferred Terms (PT) Aggression or Anger. In addition, a few cases included PTs Hostility, Homicidal Ideation, and Violence-related symptom.
Two thirds of the reports were very sparsely documented, lacking a description of the event itself and circumstances under which it occurred, as well as tapentadol therapy details. In the remaining cases aggression was reported together with one or more of the following underlying disorders such as: bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and/or concomitant medication known to cause aggressiveness (tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazepines) or alcohol use. These confound the causality assessment for tapentadol (data on file).
Based on the available review of post-marketing cases, it can be concluded that the currently available information is not supportive of tapentadol induced aggression and/or hostility.

Discussion and Conclusion
Tapentadol is a centrally acting analgesic, combining mu-opioid agonist and noradrenalin- reuptake inhibitor activity in a single molecule. Aggression, as a behavior and socialization disturbance, is not known so far to be caused by morphine as the prototypical opiate. An opioid class effect for aggression has not been established as well. To date, only one publication could be found which discussed the relationship between opioids and aggressive responding as
 
possible1; however this claim has not been confirmed to date. Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors have not shown to cause such adverse reaction either.
Some other psychiatric disorders constitute adverse drug reactions for tapentadol, such as: restlessness, perception disturbancies, agitation, thinking abnormal. However, the labeling of these events as adverse drug reactions for tapentadol is not sufficient factor to draw the conclusion that aggressive reaction is also expected, as it would constitute a more specific psychiatric disorder. As such, it might not be triggered by above mentioned reactions, but can be a standalone event.
Based on available up-to-date information on tapentadol, there is no pattern observed in occurrence of aggression and/or hostility in patients treated with this substance. Information from the clinical development program and post- marketing case reports do not contain sufficient evidence for an association between events listed in Hostility/Aggression SMQ and tapentadol.
Nevertheless, the medical concept of aggression will be further monitored and targeted questions will be implemented in the follow up of spontaneous case reports, in order to obtain relevant missing information.
