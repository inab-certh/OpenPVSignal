This is in agreement with what is known of this particular reaction’s latency. In one case, the reaction reverted after cessation of the drug. Conversely, previous conditions such as kaposi sarcoma or other concomitant reactions including liver injury which appeared in these patients might somehow explain this particular reaction.
The association as estimated by the IC values is statistically significant, IC=1.58; IC025=0.32, meaning that the association is occurring more frequently than statistically expected. On the other hand, increased ALP is not a proper condition but a non-specific indicator of different conditions, mainly liver injury or bone mineral loss. These conditions are known to occur in the course of long treatments with these medications and in fact they did occur in the cases assessed. There is clear evidence in the literature that this reaction is associated with this fixed-dose combination, in particular with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Therefore, it is very likely that the fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine, efavirenz and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate has increased ALP levels in those patients after several months of treatment. Since the reaction is a useful indicator, information about ALP increased should be included in the SPC of this medication.""" ;

The fixed-dose combination contains three widely used antiretroviral drugs: efavirenz (600 mg), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and emtricitabine (200 mg) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (245 mg), two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. All three active substances act by blocking the activity of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme produced by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The drug is indicated to delay damage to the immune system and thus the development of infections and diseases associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The drug does not cure HIV or AIDS. The most severe but rare reactions that have been associated with this combination are osteomalacia, a condition manifested as bone pain and infrequently contributing to fractures, hepatitis and  renal failure.

and bone mineral density loss are made in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) of the fixed-dose combination of emtricitabine, efavirenz and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, there is no
explicit mention of increased ALP.5 Several epidemiological studies have found a relationship between the drug combination and this ADR. In a follow-up study comprising patients initiating (n=657), reinitiating (n=361) and discontinuing (n=73) combined antiretroviral therapy, tenofivir disoproxil fumarate was associated with a significant increase of ALP.6 There was no correlation with glomerular filtration rates, changes in serum alanine aminotransferase or active hepatitis C. According to the authors, this suggests that the increase in ALP is due to the bone isoenzyme and indicates that stimulated bone turnover is due to loss of bone mineral density. Similarly, in an open-label study (n=385), all markers of bone density loss were significantly greater in the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate- emtricitabine treatment group than in the
abacavir-lamivudine group at week 24. Finally, a
cross-sectional study (n=1077) found that efavirenz and tenofovir were associated with ALP increased.7,8""" ;

On 16 August 2013 the World Health Organization (WHO) Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) notified
the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) for Atripla (Bristol-Myers Squibb and Gilead Sciences Limited) of a potential safety signal for the product (increased alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) and invited the MAH to comment on the signal.
Gilead is the holder of the global safety database for Atripla and is responsible for the production of aggregate reports and ongoing pharmacovigilance and risk management activities, in collaboration with BMS and Merck (with whom Gilead have entered into an \"Access Territory Distribution Agreement\" for countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), Canada and United States of America). Safety information received by the MAH is carefully evaluated on an ongoing basis for any new safety signals and prescribing information is updated as soon as new adverse reactions are identified.
The UMC identified 7 individual case safety reports (ICSRs) of increased ALP in association with Atripla in the WHO Global database, Vigibase. One of these cases was a duplicate. In 4 of the ICSRs identified by the UMC, the increased ALP was associated with elevations of other liver function tests, with severe hepatic events (hepatic failure, drug-induced hepatitis, cholangitis, and/or hepatic cirrhosis) reported in 3 of the 4 cases. Concurrent alcohol use (described as a drug-alcohol interaction) was reported in the fourth case. These concurrent events suggest that the elevations of ALP in these cases are hepatic in origin. In 1 ICSR the reported events of hypophosphataemia and vitamin D deficiency suggest that the elevated ALP may originate from the bone. Concurrent bone or hepatic events were not reported in the final ICSR (a report of abnormal renal function). However concurrent medications included cholecalciferol, suggesting the patient may have been deficient in
 
vitamin D. Of note, 4 of these 6 cases were already on the Gilead safety database.
The literature articles referenced in the WHO report, involving elevated ALP in patients on Atripla therapy or efavirenz with a Truvada backbone, were reviewed closely. Each of the referenced articles discussed more specific etiologies and diagnoses for the subjects' elevated ALP levels. Fux et al correlated the elevation in ALP levels in the cohort study specifically to the bone isoenzyme. The authors concluded that the elevated ALP resulted from increased bone turnover secondary to hypophosphatemia and proximal renal tubulopathy.
Stellbrink et al similarly describes elevated serum ALP in setting of increased bone turnover and decreased bone mineral density. They noted that limitations in their study included a failure to monitor phosphate and vitamin D levels. Welz et al described elevated ALP associated with Vitamin D deficiency. In subjects with elevated ALP in the setting of normal AST levels, bone turnover was likely.
The Atripla EU SmPC already includes a detailed description of hepatic and bone effects and appropriate monitoring information and there has been extensive patient exposure to Atripla to date (over 1.4 million patient-years of treatment cumulative to 30 June 2013). In addition, given the small number of cases (n=14) of increased ALP reported in the Gilead Drug Safety database (which were either reported with concurrent bone [n=1] or hepatic events [n=5], or were poorly documented [n=8]), the specific etiologies and diagnoses for the subjects' elevated ALP levels in the literature articles referenced, as well as the limited utility of elevated ALP levels alone without other clinical data to make a specific diagnosis, the MAH does not consider an update to the EU SmPC is warranted.""" ;

All reported patients did take Atripla as an antiretro-viral drug. There is one duplicate, case one and two (Table 1), which leaves a total of six cases. The gender distribution was three females and three males.
The age range was from 38 to 55 years old. The indication was reported as HIV infection in five cases and not stated in one case report. Five cases were reported by a physician and one by a pharmacist. The ICSRs were submitted from Canada (two cases), United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands and Switzerland, one case each.
In all ICSRs the patients developed other severe reactions such as: hepatic injury (four patients)
and renal injury (one patient). One died due to development of hepatic failure. In a male patient, the only reported reactions were hypophosphataemia, vitamin D deficiency and increased ALP after one year of treatment. In all cases the reaction appeared after two to 36 months of treatment, and in at least one case it reverted after the medication was stopped. The fixed-drug combination of emtricitabine, efavirenz and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was the only suspected medication in all cases. The association had an IC value of 1.58 with an IC025 value of 0.32 meaning that the reaction occurs more frequently than statistically expected.""" ;

Data from spontaneous reporting are sparse and incomplete, however, the fact that an increased ALP occurred after long treatment durations coincidental with this reaction's known latency — and along with other reactions such as hepatic injuries for which ALP is a well-known indicator, points to a causal relationship. In addition, in observational studies with different designs, a clear association between treatment with the fixed-dose combination of the three antiretroviral drugs emtricitabine, efavirenz and tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate and an increased ALP has been found. Since the reaction is a useful indicator, the information on increased ALP should be included in the Summary of Product Characteristics for this medication.""" ;

In a follow-up study comprising patients initiating (n=657), reinitiating (n=361) and discontinuing (n=73) combined antiretroviral therapy, tenofivir disoproxil fumarate was associated with a significant increase of ALP.6 There was no correlation with glomerular filtration rates, changes in serum alanine aminotransferase or active hepatitis C. According to the authors, this suggests that the increase in ALP is due to the bone isoenzyme and indicates that stimulated bone turnover is due to loss of bone mineral density" ;
