The drug’s effect on the sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors could theoretically provide an explanation for this as these receptors are also present in the atrial myocytes and nodal cells.11
The 27 ICSRs on fingolimod and T wave inversion stand out as statistically significant in the VigiBase dataset and the drug is the sole suspected drug in 26 of these cases. The large proportion of women in the ICSRs may be explained by the disease being more common  in women than men. In 13 of the cases where time to onset was recorded, the reaction was seen within two days. 19 out of 27 cases list information on the patients' medical history.
Hypertension was mentioned in four cases, three patients were reported as smoking and another three as former smokers.
Hyperlipidaemia was  reported  for  three patients and coronary  artery disease in two more cases. Of these two patients, one was diagnosed with coronary artery disease after ECG changes were recorded during FDO. Five ICSRs explicitly mention that the patients had  no preexisting cardiac morbidity or cardiac risk factors. The lack of treatment dates for the concomitant drugs that can induce arrhythmias complicates the assessment but as all these cases date after the introduction of FDO, it can be assumed that the ECG  changes reported were new observations even in those cases where there is no reference to a pre-treatment ECG.
In 14 cases the severity of the ADRs reported, including bradyarrhythmias and signs of myocardial ischemia (two patients), caused a withdrawal of the drug. There was a positive dechallenge on six of the ICSRs, only three patients were reported to have reco- vered without changes to therapy. The cases in VigiBase suggest that there is a possible causal relationship between fingolimod and T wave inversion and further investigation is warranted.""" ;

There is however an increased risk of bradyarrhytmia and AV block and the labelling information specifically recommends that all patients starting on fingolimod treatment should have an initial predose ECG and be further monitored for at least six hours. Clinical trials identified symptomatic bradycardia in 0.5% of patients receiving fingolimod compared to none on placebo. The maximum decrease in heart rate usually occurred after six hours and usually improved after this. In some cases however a second period of heart rate decrease occurred within the first 24 hours and/or after  the second dose. With continuous treatment the heart rate returned to baseline within a month. First degree AV block was reported in 0.1% of patients starting treat- ment with fingolimod whilst there were no cases for the  placebo group and the same result was recorded for second degree AV block. The AV block was usually resolved within the first 24 hours. The post marketing experience reveals third degree AV blocks, AV blocks with conjunctional delay, transient asystole, syncope and unexplained death although confounders such as concomitant medications or pre-existing disease makes this an uncertain relationship to fingolimod. Patients on drugs that prolong the QT interval should be monito- red closely for the first 24 hours after starting treatment with fingolimod due to the association with torsades de pointes in patients with bradycardia.5, 6 In a randomized phase IV study of 783 patients where three quarters received fingolimod and one quarter standard disease modifying therapy for six months, one patient was found to have biphasic T waves.12" ;

The majority of the ICSRs are from the USA (17) and the other countries represented are Germany (four), Canada (three), Finland, Ireland and the UK (one each). In December 2013 the IC value was
3.70 and the IC025 was 3.11. Age was mentioned in 23 ICSRs, ranging from 20 to 76 years old with a median age of 47. Women were represented in 22 ICSRs, only four cases were for men and one case had no gender stated.
Concomitant drugs were listed in 18 of the ICSRs and in all but two; the patients were taking drugs that are known to cause cardiac disturbances. The concomitant drugs reported included amantadine amlodipine, atropine sulphate/dephenoxylate HCl, bupropion, celecoxib, citalopram, clonazepam, desipramine, donepezil, doxepin, epinephrine, gabapentin, hydroxychloroquine, interferon beta-1b, ondansetron, oxymorphone, paroxetine, levothyroxine, lorazepam, methylprednisolone- modafinil, naproxen, salbutamol, simvastatin, tadalafil, topiramate, trazodone and venlafaxine. Treatment dates were generally lacking for these drugs.
The dose was given in 25 of the ICSRs, all stating the recommended daily dose. Time to onset was recorded in 20 of the cases, ranging from reaction occurring on the same day up to five months. In 13 cases the reaction occurred on or within two days of FDO, but in seven cases the reaction was seen at a later stage. The drug was withdrawn in 14 cases and of these five patients had recovered whilst three had not at the time of reporting. For the remaining six patients the outcome was unknown or not recorded. In seven cases the treatment had not been changed, three of these patients recovered and for the other four the outcome was unknown. The remaining six cases lacked information on any action taken regarding the medication and the outcome was recorded as unknown in five cases and not recovered in one case. Two reports listed that a rechallenge was made and in one case there was no recurrence of the event, whilst there was no information about the outcome in the other case.
Only two patients showed clinical signs of myocardial ischaemia (chest pain, dyspnoea) and both had risk factors for coronary artery disease such as heavy smoking and hyperlipidaemia. One further patient had diffuse episodes of chest pain but a concomitant lung infection. All other patients were asymptomatic and in all cases where further investigations such as echocardiogram, cardiac enzymes and/or coronary angiography were reported as performed, the results were negative with the exception of one asymptomatic patient who was found to have extensive obstructive coronary disease and underwent a threefold coronary by-pass.

In response to a WHO signal evaluation on disproportionate reporting of T-wave inversion in patients treated with fingolimod 0.5mg (approved dose in relapsing MS), Novartis presents the Company  analysis  of this signal.  To  date, 89,500 patients have been  treated with fingolimod including > 15,000 in clinical trials for a total of ~137,000 patient treatment-years.
Based on this review, Novartis does not believe the finding of isolated T-wave changes are related to fingolimod treatment.

Background
Fingolimod induces a transient dose-dependent reduction in heart rate and AV conduction upon treatment initiation. Fingolimod’s product information recom- mends first-dose monitoring in all patients, which was updated in 2012 to include ECGs before and 6 hours after fingolimod initiation.

Significance of T-wave inversion
In most cases,  T-wave  inversion  is non- specific and associated with physiological conditions. These conditions include orthostatic changes, hyperventilation,  electrolyte imbalance, vagal reflex, cold water and anxiety. Food ingestion is one of the most common causes of T-wave inversion  in  healthy individuals (Okada et al  1994).  T-wave inversion can also be  associated  with myocardial ischemia (with ST suppression), myocardial infarction (with Q waves and ST elevation) or cardiac conditions such as hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy or cardiomyopathy. Isolated T-wave inversion in asymptomatic adults is usually a normal variant (Fisch, 1997). T-wave changes should be interpreted with caution and should always be correlated with the other clinical and diagnostic findings (echocardiography, coronary angiography, cardiac enzymes etc.)

Preclinical data
In preclinical toxicity testing, no T-wave  inversion was observed in rats, guinea pigs, dogs or monkey.

Clinical trial data
Cardiovascular safety including ECGs was extensively assessed in a large number of patients under controlled conditions in fingolimod clinical studies (treatment duration was 6-24 months). Throughout the clinical program, ECGs were read by the treating physician and analyzed by an independent.

ECG laboratory. T-wave  inversions  reported as adverse events  (AEs) are presented in Table 1 whereas T-wave inversion detected as ECG abnormality are presented in Table 2. In the majority of cases, the  investigators  did not consider isolated T-wave inversion clinically relevant, thus warranting reporting as AEs.
In controlled clinical studies, there were no cases of AE related to ‘T-wave inversion’ with the approved 0.5 mg dose of fingolimod in 1,364 patients.

When data from non-controlled clinical trials  is also considered, the frequency of AE reported as T-wave inversion was 2/8,978 patients for the 0.5 mg dose.

ECGs were assessed at predetermined time- points in the placebo-controlled pivotal clinical studies (Table 2). The frequency of T-wave inversion at baseline was similar between the treatment groups and placebo. At 6 hours post- dose on day 1, near the peak cardiac effect of
 
fingolimod (peak bradycardia is observed  at 4-5 hours post-dose), Twave inversion on placebo (1.4%) exceeded the frequency of fingolimod 0.5 mg (0.9%) and fingolimod 1.25 mg (0.8%). Overall, as shown in Table 2, T- wave inversion was reported in the placebo group at a range of 0.8% to 1.7%, which was compara- ble to the 0.5 mg dose (0.6% to 1.7%) and the 1.25 mg dose (0.5% to 2.1%), over the 24-month period. The frequency of T- wave inversion on placebo reflects both the baseline prevalence and the range of these abnor- malities in the absence of active drug.
There is no indi- cation of a dose-response or a temporal relationship to treatment.
 












	
	 
Individual case safety reports from Novartis safety database
There are 26 cases of T-wave inversion out of ~ 89,500 treated patients (spontaneous, clinical trial, literature) in the Novartis safety database. All but two cases were reported  after  2012, when the label update for first- dose monitoring (including ECG) was implemented.

The onset latency was known in 23 cases. In about 50% (11/23) of cases, the event occurred during the first two days of treatment, presumably in the context of first-dose monitoring. Only eight events occurred beyond the first month of treatment initiation.

In 17 of 26 cases, the T-wave inversion in ECG was confounded by cardiac disease or preexisting abnormal ECG. In 4 cases, the information was insufficient to assess, and in the remaining 5 cases, “T-wave inversion” was an asymptomatic non-specific finding. Dechallenge and rechallenge evidence was equivocal.

Overall, the review of the 26 cases provides limited additional information.

Conclusions
The thorough analysis of all available evidence presented above does not indicate a causal relationship between T-wave inversion and fingolimod treatment.
 

•	No evidence of T-wave inversion in pre- clinical toxicity studies (across species)
•	Extensive ECG monitoring in large controlled clinical trials revealed comparable frequency of
•	T-wave inversion between fingolimod and placebo
•	In the post-marketing setting, T-wave inversion is rarely reported and two-thirds of reported events are confounded by pre- existing cardiac diseases
Fingolimod product information requires intense ECG monitoring for all patients at treatment initiation which is uncommon. In this context, and in the absence of a signal for ischemic heart disease or other pathologies that may manifest as T-wave inversions, Novartis believes this signal raised by disproportionality analysis can be explained by surveillance and reporting bias.

              OpenPVSignal:has_content """Fingolimod is an immunomodulating drug used as single treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. It was first approved in the US in 2010 and in the EU the following year. The active metabolite fingolimod phosphate binds to sphingosine 1- phosphate receptors and reduces the number of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. Although the exact mechanism is not known it is believed that fingolimod prevents the lymphocytes from moving into the central nervous system.1,2 Fingolimod given orally in a daily dose of 0.5 mg has shown to reduce the relapse frequency compared to placebo and interferon beta-1a.3,4 Common adverse drug reactions are back pain, cough, diarrhoea, head ache, influenza and increased liver enzymes.5,6 Following the unexplained death of a patient within 24 hours of receiving the first dose of fingolimod at the end of 2011, US and European regulatory authorities recommended a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) before start of treatment and a close cardiac monitoring of all patients in the first six hours after receiving the first dose (a first dose observation, FDO) and in some cases for longer.7,8

The T wave in an ECG reflects the repolarization of the ventricles and is normally concordant with the QRS complex.  Opposite polarity (i.e. negative T waves in leads with positive QRS complexes) can indicate myocardial ischaemia.9 T wave inversion is also associated with
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic regurgitation, pulmonary embolism, sepsis, hyperventilation syndrome, subarachnoid haemorrhage and severe hypocalcaemia. Patients with pericarditis can show flattened to invert T waves. Anterolateral T wave inversion can be physiological in children and adolescents as well as in well trained athletes (so called athlete’s heart).10
Multiple sclerosis (MS), the condition being treated with fingolimod, has so far not been associated with an increased incidence of cardiac disease. One recently published cohort study has, however, identified an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure in MS patients compared to a control group without MS. The study took into account co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), deep vein thrombosis and others but did not adjust for risk factors such as obesity and smoking.11""" ;

From February 2012 until December 2013, 27 Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) of T wave inversion in association with fingolimod were submitted to the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Report Database, VigiBase®. The drug is known to cause bradyarrhythmias and AV block within the first few hours of the initial dose, but labelling or literature information does not mention the occurrence of inverted T waves. Although there were in some cases concomitant drugs that may affect the heart rate and a few patients had pre- disposing factors, the analysis of the case reports suggests there is cause for further investigation." ;
