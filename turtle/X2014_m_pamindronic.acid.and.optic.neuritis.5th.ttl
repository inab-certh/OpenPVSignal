                         OpenPVSignal:has_content """Case reports in VigiBase suggest that there is a signal for the association of pamidronic acid and optic neuritis. While most of the cases have pamidronic acid as the sole suspected drug, dechallenge information is lacking as can be the case with a drug administered intravenously and periodically. Time to onset is reported in only two reports but both displayed a close association between the onset of the reaction and the last administration of pamidronic acid.

There have been two literature reports of optic neuritis in association with pamidronic acid. The product information indicates that pamidronic acid can be associated with other inflammatory ocular effects such as conjunctivitis, scleritis, iridocyclitis, iritis and uveitis so it would not be surprising if pamidronic acid can be associated with optic neuritis. In addition, the number of reports of optic neuritis for pamidronic acid and other bisphosphonates also suggests that optic neuritis may occur at a similar frequency to that of other inflammatory ocular reactions.

In conclusion, while it is possible that optic neuritis could arise from other causes in this series of reports, the case reports currently in VigiBase are suggestive that pamidronic acid could be the causative agent.

Pamidronic acid (disodium pamidronate) is a potent inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption. It binds strongly to hydroxyapatite crystals and inhibits the formation and dissolution of these crystals in vitro. Inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo may be at least partly due to binding of the drug to the bone mineral.
Pamidronate suppresses the accession of osteoclast precursors onto the bone. However, the local and direct antiresorptive effect of bone- bound bisphosphonate appears to be the predominant mode of action in vitro and in vivo.1
Pamidronic acid is indicated in the treatment of conditions associated with increased osteoclast activity including tumour-induced hypercalcaemia, osteolytic lesions and bone pain in patients with bone metastases associated with breast cancer or multiple myeloma and Paget’s disease of bone.

Ocular adverse reactions which have been reported include conjunctivitis (common), uveitis (uncommon), scleritis, episcleritis and xanthopsia (very rare) and orbital inflammation (unknown frequency).1

Optic neuritis is a common inflammatory disease of the optic nerve.2 It may cause sudden, reduced vision in the affected eye. The exact cause of optic neuritis is unknown. Conditions that have been linked with optic neuritis include autoimmune diseases, bacterial, fungal, viral and respiratory infections and multiple sclerosis.3 A number of drugs have been implicated in the development of optic neuritis including ethambutol in particular as well as linezolid, amiodarone and cGMP- specific phosphodiesterase type five inhibitors.4""" ;

The association has an IC value of 1.32 with an IC025 value of 0.35. The reports were submitted from the US (eight cases), Australia, Canada and New Zealand (one case each). The patients ranged in age from 12 to 88 years with a median of 65 years in the five cases in which this information was provided. In the 10 cases which provided the information, the gender distribution was eight females and two males.
Pamidronic acid was the only drug suspected in seven cases while the other four cases had another bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid, as a suspected drug. Four of the cases had no concomitant drugs reported while in the other six cases, the number of concomitant drugs ranged from three to 28. These indicated a population with considerable morbidity including cancer, depression, hypertension, infection and the requirement for treatment of pain, acid suppression and assistance with sleeping.
Pamidronic acid was reported to have been administered intravenously, as expected, in the eight cases which provided this information. The indication for use was included in seven reports and included multiple myeloma (two cases), breast cancer, joint pain and osteoporosis (one case each) Time to onset was reported with clarity in only two of the reports and ranged from the same day that the drug was most recently administered to one day after admi- nistration. For a drug which is administered once every three or four weeks, as it is in the treatment of bone metastases which is the indication in the majority of reports, time to onset is most meaningful when related to the most recent administration. Of the 10 reports in which the outcome was stated, it was recovered, recovering or recovered with sequelae in four cases, not recovered in two cases and the outcome was fatal in the remaining four cases. Four of the reports listed a large number of reactions which described a seriously ill population. Other ocular reactions are also described. In five cases, blindness or visual impairment was reported and this may be regarded as a symptom of optic neuritis. In one other case, iritis was reported and in the remaining case, optic ischaemic neuropathy was reported. Three of the four cases in which the outcome was fatal had a large number of reactions reported including cancer progression which was the likely cause of death in these cases.""" ;

As noted above, however, other inflammatory ocular reactions such as conjunctivitis, uveitis, scleritis, episcleritis, xanthopsia and orbital inflammation have been reported.1 There have also been  isolated reports of optic neuritis in association with pamidronic acid.5,6 Des Grottes et al described a patient who developed reversible retrobulbar optic neuritis after intravenous pamidronate therapy for established osteoporosis.5 The authors noted that this possible complication had never been previously reported and, since the patient had a history of porphyria, it suggested that bisphosphonates should be administered cautiously in patients with this disease. Stack and Tarr reported three cases of optic neuritis and uveitis in association with bisphosphonates, one case with alendronate and the other two cases with pamidronic acid.6
Other bisphosphonates are also associated with inflammatory ocular  reactions.  Table  2 indicates the numbers of reports in VigiBase of these reactions. The number of reports of optic
neuritis with the bisphosphonates is indicative that the frequency of optic neuritis may be similar to that of other inflammatory ocular reactions.
