                         OpenPVSignal:has_content """Case reports in VigiBase suggest that there is a possible signal for the association of parathyroid hormone and angina pectoris, myocardial ischaemia or myocardial infarction. PTH was the only drug suspected in all 10 cases. There were only a small number of concomitant drugs reported and few other reactions were reported.
Time to onset is not particularly suggestive of a signal in that, apart from three cases in which the onset was four days, 11 days and 10 weeks, onset was many months with a median time to onset of five months which seems long for a drug-induced effect.
If, however, the mechanism of the effect is related to serum levels of PTH, then the long time to onset may be explained by the time required for PTH levels to reach a particular level.
Dechallenge is suggestive of a signal. There were four cases with recovery and in three of those cases, the drug was withdrawn. In the other case with recovery, the drug was continued. In the two cases where the outcome was fatal, the drug was withdrawn in one case and the fate of the drug was unknown in the other. For an acute event such as myocardial infarction, however, recovery after drug withdrawal is not as meaningful as it is for an ongoing reaction such as angina.
The product information does not mention myocardial ischaemia but it is known that there are PTH receptors in the heart and it has been reported that there may be a role for PTH in the development of CHD so a mechanism for the development of myocardial ischaemia is possible. There may, of course be other explanations for the reactions reported in this case series. Most of the patients were elderly. In some of the cases, there are possible alternative explanations such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Case 5, stress in Case 6 and a history of transient ischaemic attacks, ischaemic cardiomyopathy and pulmonary fibrosis in Case 9. All cases, however, had PTH as the only suspected drug and the cases in VigiBase suggest that the association of myocardial infarction with PTH should be further reviewed.

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content """Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the most important endocrine regulator of calcium and phosphorus concentration in extracellular fluid. This hormone is secreted from cells of the parathyroid glands and finds its major target cells in bone and kidney.1 Physiological actions of PTH include stimulation of bone formation by direct effects on bone forming cells (osteoblasts) indirectly increasing the intestinal absorption of calcium and the tubular reabsorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate by the kidney. The therapeutic product is recombinant human PTH which is identical to the full-length native 84-amino acid polypeptide. It is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fractures. A significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral, but not hip fractures has been demonstrated.2
Very common adverse effects reported in clinical trials included hypercalcaemia and/or hypercalciuria which reflect the known pharmacodynamic actions of PTH in the gastrointestinal tract, the kidney, and the bone. The only other very commonly reported ADR was nausea. Also reported commonly in clinical trials were nervous system disorders such as headache and dizziness, gastrointestinal disorders such as vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and dyspepsia, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders such as muscle cramp, pain in extremity, and back pain, general disorders such as injection site erythema, fatigue and asthenia, and cardiac disorders such as palpitation.2
Myocardial ischaemia is an inadequate coronary blood supply resulting in oxygen deprivation of the myocardium.3 Angina pectoris is a symptom of myocardial ischaemia. It is characterized by attacks of precordial retrosternal pain or tightness, sometimes radiating into the back and often into the neck and the left shoulder and arm, and often precipitated by effort or excitement. It is frequently experienced in myocardial ischaemia, occurring when myocardial oxygen demand exceeds supply. It can be precipitated by increased oxygen demand (exercise) as well as by reduced supply (coronary vasoconstriction). It is associated with disturbed myocardial function.3
Angina symptoms can be caused or aggravated by drugs, including vasodilating agents, which in the presence of coronary artery obstruction may lead to more marked dilatation of healthy vessels and thereby reduce blood flow in the diseased areas, thus leading to a so-called 'steal phenomenon'.

Sometimes for the differential diagnosis, chest pain of non-cardiac origin must be excluded. Myocardial infarction is myocardial necrosis resulting from inadequate blood supply. It represents in most cases the most severe stage of ischaemic heart disease resulting from coronary atherosclerosis. It may, however, also occur as a consequence of embolization or severe spasm of a coronary artery.3

The only cardiac disorder that was reported in clinical trials was palpitations, noticeable changes in the heartbeat. There are also no reports in the literature which link angina, myocardial ischaemia or myocardial infarction with PTH. It has been noted that PTH raises the plasma calcium level by causing release of calcium from the bones, increases the absorption of calcium from the small intestine, and reduces the renal excretion of calcium. In addition to these classical PTH target organs, it appears that PTH may have effects on other tissues as well. Accordingly, PTH receptors have been demonstrated in the heart, and in vitro, PTH induces hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes.4
It has also been found that a rise in serum levels of PTH was common and related to the severity of disease and mortality in a mixed emergency department population which consisted of a broad spectrum of 140 acutely ill patients suffering from common diseases such as stroke, acute abdominal disorders, obstructive lung diseases, heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, trauma and infectious diseases.5 It is also known that primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is associated with hypertension, coronary atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases. In a population-based cross-sectional study, the Tromso Study involving 27159 subjects aged 25- 79 years, when stratified for age, the rate of coronary heart disease (CHD) was found to be higher in the subjects with serum PTH > 6.8 picomole/liter (pmol/L) than in those with normal or low serum PTH levels. The authors concluded that serum PTH predicts CHD in subjects with calcium levels within the reference range.6 This may indicate a role for PTH in the development of CHD.

In addition to these classical PTH target organs, it appears that PTH may have effects on other tissues as well. Accordingly, PTH receptors have been demonstrated in the heart, and in vitro, PTH induces hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes.4" ;

                             OpenPVSignal:has_content "Background Information The Signal team at the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (the UMC) has identified that case reports in VigiBase™ suggest that there is a possible signal for the association of parathyroid hormone and angina pectoris, myocardial ischaemia or myocardial infarction. Namely, as of 02 July 2013 there are four Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) of angina pectoris, five ICSRs of myocardial infarction and one ICSR of myocardial ischaemia in statistical association with PTH in VigiBase. The association with angina pectoris has an IC value of 1.95 with an IC025 value of 0.25. However, the IC value is negative for myocardial infarction and myocardial ischaemia, indicating no relationship between the administration of PTH and such cardiac ischemic related events in this database. The indication for use of Preotact® (rhPTH[1-84]) is osteoporosis in postmenopausal woman at high risk of fractures. Thus, the population of concern is female, mainly elderly patients. Presented here is a summary of clinical trial data, post-marketing surveillance reporting, and epidemiological evidence not showing any evidence of this potential signal and supporting the cardiovascular safety of Preotact in patients with osteoporosis. Osteoporosis Clinical Trial Data In the recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH[1-84]) summary of clinical safety, pooled data from the Phase 2 and 3 placebocontrolled studies in subjects with osteoporosis were presented. Most of the subjects (n = 2530 of the 3121) in the pooled analysis came from Study ALX1-11-93001 (TOP), which was 18 months in duration. Study CL1-11-008 (CAP) contributed 374 subjects and was of 6 months duration and the Phase 2 dose ranging study (ALX1-11-821) contributed 217 subjects and was of 12 months duration. Given that the studies in this analysis were randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled and of relatively long duration (up to 18 months), it represents the best information to date regarding any potential effect of rhPTH(1-84) on cardiovascular safety in patients with osteoporosis. All doses in placebocontrolled studies were 100 ug daily except for the Phase 2 dose-ranging trial where doses of 50, 75, and 100 ug were administered. A summary of the incidence of on-treatment, treatment-emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) of cardiac disorders by treatment group for the placebo-controlled dataset is presented in Table 1 below Overall, the frequency of subjects with any TESAE was slightly lower in the rhPTH(184) group. The incidence of cardiac ischaemic-related TESAEs of angina pectoris, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease and coronary artery occlusion in the rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects was comparable to or lower than that in placebo subjects. Table 2 shows the incidence of cardiac ischaemic-related on-treatment, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (serious and non-serious) in the placebo-controlled dataset in osteoporosis. Again, the incidence of such cardiac ischemic adverse events in rhPTH(1-84)-treated subjects was comparable to or lower than that for placebo subjects. Post-marketing Data As of 24 April 2013, rhPTH(1-84) (Preotact®) has been marketed in 15 countries for the treatment of osteoporosis at a labeled dose of 100 ug/day. Based on the number of units of Preotact sold, the patient exposure is estimated to be approximately 61,091 patient years of treatment. As reported in the Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs), the reported serious cardiovascular-related cases (Table 1) were not unexpected considering the advanced age and prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the patient population treated with Preotact. Moreover, as reported most of the subjects had prior history or risk factors for the adverse event in question or were taking concomitant medications which could cause or contribute to the event. Epidemiological Studies in Cardiovascular Disease Incidence A comparison with the expected incidence of coronary ischaemic events in the EU and US does not show an increase in the number of observed cases of angina pectoris, myocardial ischemia, or myocardial infarction in the VigiBase. Summary and Discussion Based on a thorough medical evaluation of the available data, including a pooled analysis of randomized, prospective placebo-controlled trials, there is currently no evidence for a direct causal relationship between angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischaemia nor any cardiac adverse event and PTH(1-84) treatment in patients with osteoporosis. Two of the three cardiac ischemic events noted in the VigiBase for Preotact, myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction, had negative IC values indicating no association. Epidemiologic data indicate that the number of cardiac ischemic related events noted in VigiBase for Preotact are within or lower than expected based on published cardiac event rates. Given the aforementioned lines of evidence, no signal for cardiac ischemic-related adverse effects of Preotact in osteoporosis patients can be discerned at the present time. Accordingly, no changes to the reference safety information for Preotact is at present considered necessary." ;

                OpenPVSignal:has_content """Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is the most important endocrine regulator of calcium and phosphorus concentration in extracellular fluid. This hormone is secreted from cells of the parathyroid glands and finds its major target cells in bone and kidney. Physiological actions of PTH include stimulation of bone formation by direct effects on bone forming cells (osteoblasts). This indirectly increases the intestinal absorption of calcium and the tubular reabsorption of calcium and excretion of phosphate by the kidney. The hormone is indicated for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fractures.
In the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Database, VigiBase™ there are currently (2 July 2013) four ICSRs of angina pectoris, five ICSRs of myocardial infarction and one ICSR of myocardial ischaemia in association with PTH. The reports are from Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Mexico and Spain. The association with angina has an IC value of 1.95 with an IC025 value of 0.25; The IC value is negative for myocardial infarction and myocardial ischaemia. PTH was the only drug suspected in all 10 cases. The outcome was stated in six ICSRs. The patients were reported as recovered in four cases and the outcome was fatal in two cases.
Case reports in VigiBase suggest that there is a signal for the association of parathyroid hormone and reactions suggesting myocardial ischaemia including angina pectoris and myocardial infarction. There were only a small number of concomitant drugs reported and few other reactions were reported in addition to the cardiac reactions. Time to onset is not particularly suggestive of a signal but if the mechanism of the effect is related to serum levels of PTH, then the long time to onset may be explained by the time required for PTH levels to reach a particular level. Dechallenge is suggestive of a signal and in three cases recovery was reported after withdrawal of the drug.
The product information does not mention myocardial ischaemia, angina pectoris or myocardial infarction but it is known that there are PTH receptors in the heart and it has been reported that there may be a role for PTH in the development of Coronary Heart Disease so a mechanism for the development of myocardial ischaemia is possible.

All cases, however, had PTH as the only suspected drug and the cases in VigiBase suggest that the association of myocardial infarction with PTH should be further reviewed." ;
