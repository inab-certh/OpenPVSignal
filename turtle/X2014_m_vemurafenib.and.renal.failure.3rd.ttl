                         OpenPVSignal:has_content """Case reports in VigiBase suggest that there is a signal for the association of vemurafenib and renal failure.
There are 23 reports of ARF, 14 reports of CRF and one report of renal failure aggravated with both ARF and CRF described in one report. There are some issues in terminology with the reports of CRF. In MedDRA, there are separate preferred terms (PTs) for ARF, CRF and renal failure  (RF). In WHO-ART, however, RF  is an included term with CRF in the PTCRF. This means that reports of CRF may be renal failure without further qualification. Vemurafenib was the only drug suspected in all 38 cases except three. In these three cases, there was one other suspected drug: ibuprofen, iodine and piperacillin/tazobactam.
Time to onset was reported in 14 of the reports and ranged from two days to six months. The six reports with a time to onset within a month are suggestive of a drug-induced effect. The outcome was stated in 21 reports. The patients were reported as recovered or recovering in 12 cases, not recovered in six cases and the outcome was fatal in two reports. The cases of recovery or recovering on drug withdrawal and the case of recurrence of renal failure on rechallenge are highly suggestive of a drug-induced effect.
Concomitant drugs were reported in 23 cases and included drugs used in a patient population which might be at risk of renal failure due to the presence of hypertension, diabetes and infection. There were also a number of concomitant reactions that may have caused or made a contribution to the cause of the renal failure. It is also possible that the underlying disease may have been responsible in some cases.
There are no reports in the literature of renal failure in association with vemurafenib. There is, however, an isolated report of renal failure in a patient taking vemurafenib, and a recent review of the on-target toxicities of TKIs noted that renal failure is an effect of  the TKIs bosutinib, dasatinib, erlotinib, imatinib, nilotinib, sorafenib and sunitinib.5 In conclusion, although renal failure may have other possible causes in this series of patients, the use of  vemurafenib appears the most likely reason.

Mutations in the BRAF gene which substitute the valine at amino acid position 600 result in constitutively activated BRAF proteins, which can cause cell proliferation in the absence of growth factors that would normally be required for proliferation.1 Before taking vemurafenib, patients must have BRAF V600 mutation-positive tumour status confirmed by a validated test. It is one of the medications widely known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) but should be referred to as protein kinase inhibitors because although the earliest drugs in this class were TKIs, they can now be further categorized based upon the amino acid that they phosphorylate:  serine,  threonine or tyrosine. Vemurafenib is indicated in monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The most common adverse drug reactions (ADR) reported with vemurafenib (>30%) reported with vemurafenib include arthralgia, fatigue, rash, photosensitivity reaction, nausea, alopecia and pruritus. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CuSCC) was very commonly reported and was most commonly treated by local excision. There are warnings in the product information concerning the possible occurrence of severe hypersensitivity and dermatological reactions, QT prolongation, serious ophthalmologic reactions, new primary melanomas, liver laboratory abnormalities and mild to severe photosensitivity.1
Renal failure is a reduction or suppression of the excretory function of the kidney, characterized by a decrease in creatinine clearance.2  Renal failure is demonstrated by an increase in serum creatinine above 150 mmol/L, or reduction in creatinine clearance below 50 mL/ min per 1.73 m2 of body surface. Age, sex, weight and whether the patient is pregnant should be considered in determining abnormality of levels of serum creatinine or creatinine clearance. The presenting symptoms of drug-induced renal failure are the same as those for renal failure due to other causes. Drugs can cause renal failure, which may be acute (developing within hours or days), subacute (within weeks), or chronic (within months or years); they may also exacerbate pre- existing renal failure. Whenever possible in reporting a suspected adverse drug reaction, the pre-existing level of renal function should be included in addition to the actual change in function.2
The cause of acute renal failure (ARF) can be characterised based on where the injury has occurred.3 Pre-renal causes include hypovolaemia, dehydration due to vomiting, diarrhoea, sweating or fever, poor intake of  fluids, medications such as diuretic’s and abnormal blood flow due to obstruction. Renal causes include sepsis, medications such as NSAIDs, antibiotics such as aminoglycosides, lithium and iodine, rhabdomyolysis, multiple myeloma and glomerulonephritis. Post-renal causes include obstruction of the bladder or the ureters, prostatic hypertrophy or prostate cancer, abdominal tumours or kidney stones. The most common causes of chronic renal failure (CRF) are poorly controlled diabetes, poorly controlled hypertension and chronic glomerulonephritis. Other causes 
include polycystic kidney disease, reflux nephropathy, kidney stones and prostate disease.3""" ;

ICSR Database, VigiBaseTM. The association has an IC value of 1.30 with an IC025 value of 0.66. In addition there are 16 ICSRs of CRF in association with vemurafenib.  The association has an IC value of 1.08 with an IC025 value of
0.28. There is also one ICSR of renal failure aggravated (IC 0.83, IC025 -2.97).
The cases can be analysed together. There are pairs of duplicates in the ARF and in the CRF series (Table 1). After elimination of duplicates, there are 38 cases. The cases were submitted from the United States (20 cases), Germany (four), Australia (three), Canada and Austria (two cases each), Belgium, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (all one each). The patients ranged in age from 38 to 89 years. The gender distribution was 22 males, 13 females and 3 not specified.
Vemurafenib was the only drug suspected in all 38 cases except three. In these three cases, there was one other suspected drug: ibuprofen, iodine and piperacillin/ tazobactam. Concomitant drugs were reported in 24 cases and included antihypertensive drugs (14 cases), proton pump inhibitors (nine), pain management drugs (10), hypolipidaemics (seven), and drugs for the treatment of diabetes, constipation and infection (five each). There was also use of allopurinol and corticosteroids (five cases each).
Time to onset was reported in 14 of the 38  ICSRs. It ranged from three days to six months. The outcome was stated in 21 reports. The patients were reported as recovered or recovering in 12 cases, not recovered in seven cases and the outcome was fatal in the remaining two reports. The reason for death in one case was renal failure, hepatic failure and sepsis while in the other case, renal failure was stated to be contributory to the death. In another case in which the patient had not recovered from renal failure, the patient died, with the cause of death given as respiratory arrest. In the ICSRs were the outcome was reported as recovered or recovering, there was a positive dechallenge in three cases. In one of these cases, there was a negative rechallenge in that the reaction did not recur when the drug was re-introduced. In five other cases, a positive dechallenge could not be confirmed to a lack of detail but appeared likely and in another three cases, recovery followed  withdrawal but onset was also after drug withdrawal. In the cases where the patients had not recovered, the drug was withdrawn in three cases, continued in one case and the dose was reduced in one case. In the remaining two cases, the patient recovered with drug withdrawal but the reaction recurred on rechallenge and the patient had not recovered from that episode.
Other reactions were described in 31 of the reports. These reactions included skin reactions, abnormal liver function, nausea, diarrhoea, joint problems, dehydration and cardiac failure, vomiting and infection. Many of these reactions may have caused or made a contribution to the cause of the ARF.""" ;

Thank you for the opportunity to provide our comments on your article, acute renal failure with vemurafenib.
Roche already completed an assessment of this adverse event on 15 October 2013. This signal was detected internally during the company’s review of Serious Unlisted Related (SUR) listings last July. In the SUR listing review, the number of renal events was raised as a concern as well as a literature abstract1 that reported the deterioration of renal function in a group of patients receiving vemurafenib. In September of this year, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) also requested Roche to review cases of acute renal failure and to look into the role of dehydration to identify plausible mechanisms, groups at risk, and the role of other factors in the occurrence of this event.
A cumulative review of vemurafenib cases entered in the Roche global drug safety database until 25 June 2013 was undertaken using the broad MedDRA SMQ for acute renal failure (ARF) which includes preferred terms of renal failure, renal impairment, clinical manifestations of oedema, decreased urine output, and abnormal laboratory findings of creatinine and blood urea among others. Data from preclinical studies, clinical trials, epidemiologic studies and the published literature were also reviewed.
There were 156 cases retrieved from the search of which 93 case reports were confirmed to include significant acute kidney injury (AKI) or acute renal failure. In 8 of the 93 cases, ARF was caused secondary to drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), which is a labelled event. The majority, 49 out of the 93 cases, presented with alternative risk factors other than vemurafenib treatment: 19 cases (20.4 %) occurred in association with adverse events of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or dehydration and in three cases (3.2%) due to aggravation of pre-existing dehydration. The remaining 36 cases presented with insufficient information.
Using a recent population-based study2 which estimated the incidence of acute renal failure per the RIFLE classification including all severity levels of risk: injury, failure, loss of kidney function, end-stage renal disease among patients with cancer by type, we compared the number of cases retrieved from our search .In that study, the incidence of all severity grades of RIFLE combined was 4.5% among melanoma patients with a baseline creatinine measurement and  1.6% among melanoma patients without a baseline creatinine measurement. Based on an
 


estimated cumulative exposure of 19,926 vemurafenib patients and the 156 cases identified from the broad SMQ of Acute Renal Failure (includes terms of non-confirmed events of ARF such as increased creatinine), a conservative reporting rate of AKI/ARF for vemurafenib is 0.8% (156/19,926), lower than the rate of ARF for metastatic melanoma patients cited in the above literature (1.6% - 4.5%).
In addition, laboratory results from the pivotal randomized phase III trial, NO25026 (BRIM3) showed that there is no difference between arms (vemurafenib versus dacarbazine) in higher grades (3 + 4) of creatinine increase. This finding supports that vemurafenib is not directly nephrotoxic.
After this review of the available clinical data, a direct nephrotoxic effect of vemurafenib cannot be established. Although cases of dehydration (caused by nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea, which are labelled events for vemurafenib) were identified to precede the AKI/ARF, the small number of these cases seen during this assessment within the context of the terminally ill patient population, a causal relationship cannot be established. Roche concluded that vemurafenib is not causally associated with ARF. Roche continues to closely monitor the events of AKI/ARF and related event of dehydration.

                OpenPVSignal:has_content "Vemurafenib is a low molecular weight, orally available, inhibitor of BRAF serine-threonine kinase (a member of the Raf kinase family of growth signal transduction protein kinases). It is one of the medications widely known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) but should be referred to as protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs). Vemurafenib is indicated in monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with BRAF V600 mutation- positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In the WHO Global Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Database, VigiBaseTM there are currently (3 September 2013) 25 ICSRs of renal failure acute (ARF) in association with vemurafenib. In addition, there are 16 ICSRs of renal failure chronic (CRF) in association with vemurafenib, both combinations with a positive IC value. There is also one ICSR of renal failure aggravated. After elimination of duplicates, there are 38 ICSRs of renal failure. Vemurafenib was the only drug suspected in all but three cases. Time to onset was reported in 14 cases and ranged from three days to six months. The six reports with a time to onset within a month are suggestive of a drug-induced effect. Patients were reported as recovered or recovering in 12 cases, not recovered in seven cases and the outcome was fatal in two ICSRs. The cases reported as recovered or recovering together with the two cases of rechallenge are highly suggestive of a drug-induced effect. In conclusion, although renal failure may have other possible causes in this series of patients, the use of vemurafenib appears the most likely reason." ;

                               OpenPVSignal:has_content "Renal failure is a reduction or suppression of the excretory function of the kidney, characterized by a decrease in creatinine clearance.2 Renal failure is demonstrated by an increase in serum creatinine above 150 mmol/L, or reduction in creatinine clearance below 50 mL/ min per 1.73 m 2 of body surface. Age, sex, weight and whether the patient is pregnant should be considered in determining abnormality of levels of serum creatinine or creatinine clearance. The presenting symptoms of drug-induced renal failure are the same as those for renal failure due to other causes. Drugs can cause renal failure, which may be acute (developing within hours or days), subacute (within weeks), or chronic (within months or years); they may also exacerbate pre-existing renal failure. Whenever possible in reporting a suspected adverse drug reaction, the pre-existing level of renal function should be included in addition to the actual change in function.2 The cause of acute renal failure (ARF) can be characterised based on where the injury has occurred.3 Pre-renal causes include hypovolaemia, dehydration due to vomiting, diarrhoea, sweating or fever, poor intake of fluids, medications such as diuretic’s and abnormal blood flow due to obstruction. Renal causes include sepsis, medications such as NSAIDs, antibiotics such as aminoglycosides, lithium and iodine, rhabdomyolysis, multiple myeloma and glomerulonephritis. Post-renal causes include obstruction of the bladder or the ureters, prostatic hypertrophy or prostate cancer, abdominal tumours or kidney stones. The most common causes of chronic renal failure (CRF) are poorly controlled diabetes, poorly controlled hypertension and chronic glomerulonephritis. Other causes include polycystic kidney disease, reflux nephropathy, kidney stones and prostate disease.3" ;
