It is notable that in none of the cases are there any past histories of depression or concomitant medication use implying a history of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, the time to onset is relatively short for two of the cases, within hours to days. All cases had documentation of resolution of symptoms after drug withdrawal.
The highly selective nature of prucalopride has been the focal point of the development of this agent given the limitations of its predecessors. To this end, multiple preclinical investigations into the cardiac effects have been completed and showed a lack of interaction with the hERG potassium channel and 5-HT1D and 5-HT2B receptors. Both approval reports from the EU and Canada thoroughly described this data. However, there is an inconsistency in the presentation of data regarding potential psychiatric effects between the EU and the Canadian reports. As a result, there is no labelling for such events in the EU SmPC (or inclusion of these events into the Risk Management Plan) but the inclusion of the events of anxiety, confusional state, and depression in the Canadian label.
It is clear that prucalopride represents therapeutic alternative with an improved safety profile and that the signal for an association with suicidal ideation is weak at the current time. However, the potential for psychiatric adverse events should be acknowledged in the EU as has been done in Canada. Furthermore, with the identification of these case reports of suicidal ideation, a possible recommendation would be for increased surveillance for such events related to suicide. Additionally, the potential for a relationship between adverse events with prucalopride and certain 5-HT4 polymorphisms should be explored.""" ;

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content """Prucalopride was licensed for use by the European Medicines Agency in July 2009 and in Canada in December 2011 with an indication for use in the 
symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation in women in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief.1,2
Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) acts as a neurotransmitter and paracrine agent that mediates a wide variety of functions, including cognitive and emotional processes, regulation of sleep and food intake, as well as cardiovascular and gastrointestinal mechanisms. To date 14 different 5-HT receptors, classified into seven subclasses, have been identified.3
Prucalopride is a dihydro-benzofurancarboxamide derivative which is highly selective and has high affinity for serotoninergic 5-HT4 receptors. 5-HT4 receptors are located both in the central nervous system (CNS) and in the peripheral tissues, specifically the gastrointestinal tract. Activation of 5-HT4 in the gastrointestinal tract promotes gastrointestinal motility and mucosal secretion.
Experimental models both in vitro and in vivo have demonstrated that prucalopride facilitates gastrointestinal motility by promoting longitudinal smooth muscle contractility while suppressing the resistance to propulsion due to circular smooth muscle contraction.4
The highly selective nature of prucalopride for the 5-HT4 receptor represents an advantage over previous prokinetic non-selective 5-HT4 agonists, such as cisapride and tegaserod. Both of these agents have appreciable affinity for other receptors, channels or transporters [e.g. cisapride: human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG)/K+ channel and tegaserod: 5-HT1D and 5-HT2B receptors] which resulted in adverse event profiles (QT prolongation and cardiovascular ischemic events, respectively) which limited their clinical success.5-7
The European Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for prucalopride notes the most commonly occurring events to be headache, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain. Other commonly occurring events were dizziness, fatigue, pollakiuria, vomiting, dyspepsia, rectal haemorrhage, flatulence, and abnormal bowel sounds. Uncommon events included palpitations, anorexia, and tremors.8 The labelling for Health Canada in contrast notes the following events from the Psychiatric disorders SOC: anxiety, confusional state, and depression.9
Suicidal ideation is defined as thoughts about self- harm, with deliberate consideration or planning of possible techniques of causing one’s own death.10 Suicidal ideation is more common than suicide attempts or completed suicide.11 A 1995 study found that 3.3 percent of patients in an urban primary care outpatient clinic reported suicidal ideation.12 Risk factors for suicidal behaviours include female gender, younger age, fewer years of education, unmarried status and the presence of a mental disorder, with psychiatric comorbidity significantly increasing risk.13 In addition, some prescription drugs, such as selective serotonin re- uptake inhibitors, can have suicidal ideation as a side effect.""" ;

The first approved agent was cisapride which has subsequently been removed from both the US and EU markets secondary to cardiovascular events, specifically QT-prolongation.
A second agent, tegaserod, was initially licensed in the US for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, but an observed increased risk in myocardial infarctions and strokes led to its withdrawal five years after approval. Tegaserod was never approved for use in the EU. In the refusal assessment report from the EMA’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP), it is noted that findings in mice safety pharmacology studies suggest certain CNS related effects, such as increased activity, abnormal gait, and hypothermia at doses 10 to 100-fold higher than therapeutically relevant. Furthermore, it is reported that 2.1% of all tegaserod subjects reported adverse events in the Psychiatric disorders SOC (compared to 1.6% in placebo subjects). There were a total of six deaths in subjects taking tegaserod during clinical development, two of which were reported as suicide (12,032 total subjects in the safety database received tegaserod); no deaths were felt by the investigator to be related to study drug.
CNS/psychiatric events were considered to be an outstanding safety issue.15
Prucalopride is the third 5-HT4 receptor agonist. It has not been approved for licensure in the US; however, it was approved for use in chronic constipation in the EU in 2009 and in Canada in 2011. In the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use approval assessment report, it is noted that in single dose toxicity studies performed on mice that there were CNS effects seen “at very high doses” However, there was no discussion in the report regarding events from the Psychiatric disorders SOC. There were two deaths in the double-blind placebo controlled trials and four deaths in open-label studies. The report notes only that none of the deaths were considered related to treatment by the investigator. Neither suicidal ideation nor other CNS events are included in the risk management plan for prucalopride.1 In contrast, the Summary Basis of Decision for Health Canada notes that prucalopride: “…may act on receptors in the brain having the following 5- hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors: 5-HT1; 5- HT2; and 5-HT3; that could be involved in anxiety and depression. It is unclear whether 5-HT4 may be related to depression and anxiety. However, anxiety has been reported in many clinical studies and some cases were reported as serious events. The open-label studies recorded anxiety in 1.9%  of the patients treated with the 2 mg dose, and similar results were found with 4 mg dose. In these studies, depression was elicited at a higher incidence than anxiety (3.5% versus 1.9%) with the 2 mg dose.”2. The 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4-R) is located both in the CNS and in the peripheral tissues. In the human brain, 5-HT4-Rs have been localized in the basal ganglia, the hippocampal formation and the cortical mantle.3 It could be hypothesized that prucalopride, acting upon the 5-HT4 receptors in the basal ganglia could lead to a syndrome of dysphoria and suicidal ideation, as substantia nigra hyperactivity has been implicated in schizophrenia.11 Also, available evidence for another serotonin receptor agonist, metoclopromide, suggest that different polymorphisms in 5-HT4 receptor HTR4 genes are associated with adverse events and clinical effectiveness. There is the potential that only patients with certain genetic variations in the 5- HT4 receptor are susceptible to neuropsychiatric side effects.16

Neither suicidal ideation nor other CNS events are included in the risk management plan for prucalopride.1 In contrast, the Summary Basis of Decision for Health Canada notes that prucalopride: “…may act on receptors in the brain having the following 5- hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors: 5-HT1; 5- HT2; and 5-HT3; that could be involved in anxiety and depression. It is unclear whether 5-HT4 may be related to depression and anxiety. However, anxiety has been reported in many clinical studies and some cases were reported as serious events. The open-label studies recorded anxiety in 1.9%  of the patients treated with the 2 mg dose, and similar results were found with 4 mg dose. In these studies, depression was elicited at a higher incidence than anxiety (3.5% versus 1.9%) with the 2 mg dose.”2 The 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4-R) is located both in the CNS and in the peripheral tissues. In the human brain, 5-HT4-Rs have been localized in the basal ganglia, the hippocampal formation and the cortical mantle.3 It could be hypothesized that prucalopride, acting upon the 5-HT4 receptors in the basal ganglia could lead to a syndrome of dysphoria and suicidal ideation, as substantia nigra hyperactivity has been implicated in schizophrenia.11 Also, available evidence for another serotonin receptor agonist, metoclopromide, suggest that different polymorphisms in 5-HT4 receptor HTR4 genes are associated with adverse events and clinical effectiveness. There is the potential that only patients with certain genetic variations in the 5- HT4 receptor are susceptible to neuropsychiatric side effects.16""" ;

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content """Response from Shire

Suicide-related events include passive and active thinking, planning, and finally taking action to commit suicide. Passive death thoughts are common in the general population. In a cross- national (17 countries) sample, Nock et al estimated the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation at 9.2% (1).
For prucalopride there was no signal for suicide- related events in the developmental clinical trials of this product for chronic constipation.
The Shire global safety database contains the same postmarketing reports tabulated by the authors and, except for one duplicate, no other report of suicide-related events.
In review of the three postmarketing cases in the database, the first case involved a male of unknown age and was derived from sparse documentation which included no information on medical history or concurrent disorders. The second case involved a 44-year old female who was concomitantly treated with tramadol, a medication with a known association with suicidal events and depression (2,3).
The third and most recent case was presented as a published case report where suicidal thoughts were reported amongst a plethora of other events including balance difficulty, prostration, visual hallucinations, amnesia and disorientation.
Interestingly, the publication failed to mention this patient’s concomitant treatment with brotizolam, a benzodiazepine. The constellation of events described is considered to be clinically compatible with a paradoxical benzodiazepine reaction given that such reactions may typically include hallucinations, inconsolable crying, agitation, restlessness, disorientation, aggressive behaviour and/other psychological phenomena (4).
Additionally, benzodiazepine use has been identified in at least one published study as among a number of variables associated with suicide in older adults (5).
In summary, suicide-related events did not constitute a signal during clinical development of prucalopride. In the postmarketing review, 2 of the 3 case reports of suicidal ideation were confounded by potentially relevant concomitant medication exposures, and the third case report was poorly documented. Based on the information available at this time, Shire does not believe there is sufficient evidence to support a causal association of suicidal ideation with the use of prucalopride.

It is unclear whether 5-HT4 may be related to depression and anxiety. However, anxiety has been reported in many clinical studies and some cases were reported as serious events. The open-label studies recorded anxiety in 1.9% of the patients treated with the 2 mg dose, and similar results were found with 4 mg dose. In these studies, depression was elicited at a higher incidence than anxiety (3.5% versus 1.9%) with the 2 mg dose.”2" ;

Prucalopride is the third 5-HT4 receptor agonist licensed as a prokinetic agent but its highly selective nature represents an advantage over the previously licensed products cisapride and tegaserod which have both been withdrawn due to adverse cardiac effects. While the total number of case reports for suicidal ideation and prucalopride is small, there is evidence of psychiatric events, specifically anxiety, confusional state, and depression, from clinical trial data as well as a notable number of reports of suicidal ideation for tegaserod. Of potential concern is the inconsistency in the labelling for CNS events between the EU and Canada, the two regions in which prucalopride has been approved. The potential for psychiatric adverse events should be acknowledged in the EU as has been done in Canada. Furthermore, with the identification of these case reports of suicidal ideation, a possible recommendation would be for increased surveillance for such events related to suicide. Additionally, the potential for a relationship between adverse events with prucalopride and certain 5-HT4 polymorphisms should be explored." ;
