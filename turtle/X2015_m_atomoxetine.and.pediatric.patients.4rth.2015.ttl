However, the possible association of atomoxetine with dystonia appears restricted to the adolescent and paediatric population. A possible mechanism may be based on inhibition of dopamine uptake." ;

                   OpenPVSignal:has_content "Case reports in VigiBase® suggest that there is a possible signal for the association of atomoxetine and dystonia in children and adolescents. Atomoxetine was the only drug suspected in 21 of the 31 cases. In the remaining 10 cases, other suspected drugs would appear to be a more likely cause in seven reports but atomoxetine would appear an equally likely cause in the other three cases. Time to onset was reported in only two of the reports and ranged from the same day the drug was administered to 24 days. The outcome of the dystonia was indicated in 17 reports. The patients were reported as recovered or recovering in 16 cases and not recovered in the remaining case. In the cases where recovery was reported, the drug was withdrawn in 13 cases, continued in one case and the fate of the drug was unknown in the remaining two cases. In the case where the patient had not recovered, the drug was continued. The fact there was a positive dechallenge in 13 of the 16 reports where recovery was documented is suggestive of a druginduced effect. The possible association of atomoxetine with dystonia appears restricted to the adolescent and paediatric population. There is a total of 33 reports of dystonia in association with atomoxetine in the total population where the age is known. Thirtyone of these reports were reported in the adolescent and paediatric age groups which represents 93.9% of all the reports. While it may be considered that atomoxetine is used preferentially in the younger age groups, overall reporting in VigiBase® indicates that of the 16,592 reports submitted, the age group from 2 to 17 years represents 72.3% of the total reports in which the age is known. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying acute extrapyramidal symptoms such as dystonia are usually attributed to the effects of dopamine receptor blockade in the basal ganglia.4 As atomoxetine is a weak inhibitor of dopamine uptake, it is possible that this may be the basis of a possible mechanism. It is also possible that children and adolescents may be at greater risk as it is known that younger age is a risk factor for the development of dystonia in patients receiving antipsychotic treatment.3 " ;

                   OpenPVSignal:has_content """As of 1 September 2014, after the elimination of suspected duplicates, there are a total of 40 individual case safety reports (ICSRs) of dystonia in association with atomoxetine in the WHO Global ICSR database, VigiBase®. Out of these reports there are 31cases of dystonia in children and adolescents up to 17 years of age (Table 1). Of the remaining reports one is a 51 year old and one a 24 year old and the rest are have reported age unknown. The reports from children and adolescents were submitted from the United States (20 reports), Australia (2), South Africa (2), Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Spain and Switzerland (1 each). The patients ranged in age from 5 to 17 years with a median of 9 years. There were 23 males and 8 females. Atomoxetine was the only drug suspected in 21 of the 31 cases. There were other drugs also suspected in the remaining 10 cases and they included drugs for treatment of psychotic disorders in seven cases, drugs for treatment of depression (3 cases), epilepsy (3 cases) and ADHD (3 cases). In seven of these 10 cases, at least one of these drugs (olanzapine, ziprasidone, risperidone, chlorpromazine) is a likely cause. Antipsychotic drugs are a well-known cause of dystonia and the four drugs listed above all refer to dystonia as a possible adverse effect in their product information.3 Concomitant drugs were reported in 20 of the 31 cases and showed a similar trend to that observed with the co-suspected drugs with considerable use of antipsychotic, anticonvulsant, and antidepressant drugs along with the use of other treatments for ADHD. Time to onset was reported in only two of the reports and ranged from the same day the drug was administered to 24 days. The outcome of the dystonia was indicated in 17 reports. The patients were reported as recovered or recovering in 16 cases and not recovered in the remaining case. In the cases where recovery was reported, the drug was withdrawn in 13 cases, continued in one case and the fate of the drug was unknown in the remaining two cases. In the case where the patient had not recovered, the drug was continued. The indication for use was stated in 23 reports and indicated ADHD or a related disease in all 23 cases. Dosage ranged from 10 mg to 160 mg (median: 25 mg) in the 16 cases which reported this information. Other reactions were reported in 26 of the 31 reports. Other neuropsychiatric reactions were reported in 23 of those reports and six reports described gastrointestinal reactions. Changes in drug levels, changes in therapeutic response or medicine ineffective were reported in eight cases.

                OpenPVSignal:has_content "Atomoxetine is a relatively potent inhibitor of the presynaptic noradrenaline transporter, a moderate inhibitor of 5HT uptake, and a weak inhibitor of dopamine uptake with minimal affinity for the other noradrenergic receptors. It is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as defined by DSM-IV criteria in children 6 years of age and older, adolescents and adults. After the elimination of suspected duplicates there are currently (1 September 2014) 31 individual case safety reports (ICSRs) in the WHO Global ICSR database, VigiBase® of dystonia in association with atomoxetine for children and adolescents up to 17 years of age. The reports are from Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland and the United States. Atomoxetine was the only drug suspected in 21 of the 31 cases. The outcome of the dystonia was indicated in 17 reports. The patients were reported as recovered or recovering in 16 cases and not recovered in the remaining case. In the cases where recovery was reported, the drug was withdrawn in 13 cases, continued in one case and the fate of the drug was unknown in the remaining two cases. Case reports in VigiBase® suggest that there is a possible signal for the association of atomoxetine and dystonia. The fact there was a positive dechallenge in 13 of the 16 reports where recovery was documented is suggestive of a druginduced effect. However, the possible association of atomoxetine with dystonia appears restricted to the adolescent and paediatric population. A possible mechanism may be based on inhibition of dopamine uptake. " ;

Eli Lilly & Company (Lilly) routinely queries reported adverse events in databases (Lilly’s internal safety database and FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) for early signs of potential adverse drug reactions in patients treated with Lilly drugs. Lilly recognizes the importance of early signal detection and also acknowledges that database queries are only one method that can be employed. Additionally, Lilly’s reviews of the spontaneously reported adverse events involve medical assessment of the narratives where information provided and not captured in the standard fields often helps to refine the assessment. Consistent with the Uppsala Monitoring Centre, Lilly recognizes that signals are uncertain and preliminary in nature (Uppsala Monitoring Centre, Signals selected by UMC and the clinical review panel: How the process works). This is because, for any given adverse event report considered in generating a signal, there is no certainty that the adverse event was caused by the suspected drug. Rather, the adverse event could have resulted from the underlying condition being treated, a comorbid condition, a concomitant medication, or may simply be the result of chance. Treatment-emergent dystonias have been associated with reduced dopamine neurotransmission in the basal ganglia, as typically described with antipsychotic medications such as risperidone or quetiapine (Tarsy and Simon, 2006). In this respect, it is pertinent that atomoxetine and other attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications are not infrequently given in conjunction with concomitant medications including antipsychotic medications to treat the commonly occurring comorbid conditions associated with ADHD. Furthermore, as Dr Boyd mentioned in his assessment, younger individuals may be at greater risk of developing dystonia when they receive antipsychotic treatment. Lilly agrees with Dr Boyd’s observation that in seven of the 31 cases co-suspect antipsychotic medications were a likely cause. Lilly also agrees with Dr Boyd’s comment that, upon review of the data in Table 1, concomitant drugs were reported in 20 of the 31 cases and that these showed a similar trend to that observed with the co-suspected drugs with considerable use of antipsychotic, anticonvulsant, and antidepressant drugs. This observation seems to indicate that, although not considered suspect per se, many cases involved concomitant medications that have been associated with dystonic or other similar movement effects and hence, may also possibly be confounded. Based on in vivo preclinical data, atomoxetine enhances dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, but not in the basal ganglia (i.e. striatum; Bymaster et al. 2002). Therefore, the mechanism by which atomoxetine could stimulate an induced dystonia via the dopaminergic pathway is unclear. In the current report, no rechallenge information was included, so Lilly presumes that none of the case reports involved a rechallenge situation. Positive dechallenge was, however, described in 13 of the 16 reports where recovery was documented. The significance of this information is not entirely clear as it was not mentioned if atomoxetine alone was stopped or if any concomitant medications (neuroleptics, antidepressants, stimulants, or other drugs) were stopped at the same time as atomoxetine or if the dystonia events may have been treated with pharmacological intervention. All of these factors would confound the assessment. Although Lilly regularly conducts ongoing surveillance, including automated signal detection for all its medications, Lilly has not previously identified a signal for dystonia with atomoxetine from any of our available data sources, including clinical trials. As noted in Dr Boyd’s evaluation, no reports of dystonia in association with atomoxetine could be found in the literature. Nevertheless, Lilly takes the information provided by the Uppsala Monitoring Centre seriously, and therefore, based on the possible signal reported by Dr Boyd, plans to conduct a comprehensive review of dystonia events in atomoxetine-treated patients.
