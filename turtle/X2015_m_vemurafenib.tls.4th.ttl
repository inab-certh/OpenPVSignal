In the literature a handful of cases of TLS in relation to malignant melanoma have ever been published, none of which concern treatment with vemurafenib but rather with other drugs or drug combinations. The reporting pattern in VigiBase® of TLS as an adverse drug reaction for any drug during recent years would suggest an overall increase in the incidence of TLS in association to targeted cancer therapy and in solid tumour indications. In line with this some authors have noted that TLS would be expected to increase also in non-hematologic malignancies with more effective treatment, i.e. targeted therapy, including vemurafenib. A causal relationship between vemurafenib and TLS is in light of this and with the reported cases not unlikely, as any effective cancer therapy can lead to TLS. As mentioned previously, while being a signal of a serious side effect, the association could equally be seen as a sign of an effective treatment. Physicians treating solid tumours should be made aware of the apparent increased risk of TLS with vemurafenib or other targeted therapies to be able to determine on a case-bycase basis the need for immediate treatment should TLS appear and also for appropriate prophylaxis.

Vemurafenib is a B-Raf enzyme inhibitor indicated for the treatment of malignant melanoma.1 It was first approved in 2011 in the US, and has since been approved in other countries including Canada, and in the EU. Vemurafenib causes programmed cell death and works in about 60% of melanoma patients whose cancer has either a V600E BRAF mutation or the more rare BRAF V600K mutation. Melanoma cells without these mutations are not inhibited by vemurafenib; instead the drug paradoxically stimulates normal BRAF and may promote tumour growth in such cases. TLS is a rare and potentially fatal syndrome where a sudden, rapid and massive lysis of tumour tissue occurs, resulting in severe disturbances in electrolytes and renal failure.2 TLS has predominantly been observed in association with various treatments for hematologic malignancies but has also been described with the treatment of solid tumours; e.g. a handful of cases having been reported in scientific literature in patients under treatment for malignant melanoma.3,4,5,6,7,8 While the VigiBase® cases herein are few and contain a relative scarcity of data and TLS is considered by some merely as a consequence or a sign of effective treatment regardless of type, the TLS finding is discussed here as a signal of a new adverse drug reaction for vemurafenib." ;

TLS is a feared acute and potentially fatal side effect of treatment of primarily hematologic or lymphatic malignancies caused by abrupt, massive tumour cell death. It is a complication of the treatment of bulky, highly proliferative, chemoresponsive disease. Signs and symptoms associated with TLS are hyperuricaemia, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hyperkalaemia with subsequent risk of acute kidney failure, cardiac arrhythmia and seizures1 with a case classification definition suggested by Cairo and Bishop in 2004.9 The incidence of TLS in different diagnoses is not known in any detail due to the variability of patients in cohorts investigated and a lack of standard diagnostic criteria used in studies. The vast majority of data on TLS incidence refer to hematologic malignancies with an incidence range between 0 and 23% and a fatality rate ranging between 0 and 2.5%.1 The high end incidence in some publications may appear to include cases of TLS diagnosed based on laboratory data without significant clinical manifestation. In solid tumours data is scarce with an incidence of TLS of 0.02% reported for colorectal cancer.1 TLS has been described in association with different treatment modalities including chemotherapy, radiation and steroids and when none of these modalities is present even as occurring spontaneously.2 Among solid tumours TLS has been seen - as expected - in both highly chemosensitive tumours (e.g. small cell carcinomas and germ cell tumours) and also in tumours less sensitive to treatment such as malignant melanoma.2,4,5,6,7,8 In TLS case histories reported in literature, in association with malignant melanoma, the TLS has occurred spontaneously or within hours to days of treatment described as corticosteroids, classic chemotherapy, monoclonal antibodies, interleukin, interferon and combinations of these. The detailed mechanism by which TLS is induced in malignant melanoma and other malignancies is largely unknown although any drug causing death of cancer cells by any mechanism may lead to TLS in certain circumstances. In lymphatic tumours, corticosteroids may induce the production of endonucleases in the malignant cells of melanoma, which leads to DNA fragmentation and eventually cell lysis.2 Treatment of TLS includes supportive care including preservation of renal function, prevention of cardiac arrhythmias and seizures. Preventive measures for high risk patients with lymphomas and leukaemias include prophylactic allopurinol or rasburicase.10" ;

                   OpenPVSignal:has_content "A search in VigiBase® in August 2014 retrieved four reports on TLS associated with vemurafenib treatment. The cases originated from Germany and the US, and presented with varying degree of information. Case 1: A 24-year-old male study patient was treated for malignant melanoma with vemurafenib at a dose of 960 mg twice daily. Dates of treatment and onset of symptoms, medical history or concurrent illness, and concomitant or past medication were not recorded. The patient was admitted to hospital with severe worsening of general condition, abdominal complaints, flank pain, nausea, vomiting and proteinuria and was diagnosed with TLS. The therapy, outcome and any causality assessment by the reporter was not provided. The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) assessed the TLS as related to vemurafenib. Case 2: A 58-year-old female patient was treated for malignant melanoma with vemurafenib in a dose of 960 mg twice daily. Concomitant medications were enoxaparin, metoclopramide, betamethasone, orlistat, levothyroxine, omeprazole, and paracetamol. The diagnosis of TLS was reported after five days of vemurafenib treatment. The patient recovered within three weeks. No further relevant information was provided but the narrative mentions a previous TLS report on a 40-year-old female for which the investigator assessed vemurafenib to be related to the event. Among the concomitant medications noted in this case was the corticosteroid betamethasone. Corticosteroids are among the agents classically associated with TLS. Treatment time and time to onset was not reported in relation to the concomitant drug betamethasone, and it was not clear whether the drug was administered before or as treatment after the event. Case 3: A patient of unknown gender and age was treated for malignant melanoma with vemurafenib with an unknown dose. The patient’s medical history, concomitant medication, concurrent conditions and past drugs were not reported. After an unspecified amount of time the patient died due to TLS; in the opinion of the reporter this was related to the treatment with vemurafenib. The patient was enrolled in a healthcare providers’ programme for malignant melanoma. The narrative indicated that this case actually described two different patients experiencing the event as described above. Case 4: A male patient was reported to have experienced TLS while receiving treatment with vemurafenib. No further relevant information was provided. As is noted from the case descriptions above, the four cases of TLS reported in relation to treatment with vemurafenib do not themselves contain enough background information to allow for a high quality causality assessment. In VigiBase® a total of 1,157 reports of TLS for all drugs in the database were present as of 12 August, 2014. The cases were predominately from the US, a majority of them concerned men, middle-aged and older, and almost all of them had been reported after 1 January, 2001. Between 1 January and 12 August, 2014, One hundred ten TLS cases were reported to VigiBase®. Half (55) of these cases concerned treatments for hematologic malignancies, 30 patients were treated for solid malignancies and 25 were treated for an unknown indication. Most commonly reported solid malignancy treatment indications were breast cancer (n=5) and colorectal cancer (n=6). Among TLS cases in solid malignancies and cases of unknown indication two thirds were treated with modern biologic/targeted therapy while one third were reportedly treated with classic chemotherapy agents or steroids only. The signal for vemurafenib may be seen as a part of a larger pattern increasing reporting of TLS in cancer treatments in general, in line with increased effectiveness of modern targeted anticancer drugs.

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content "In November 2014 the WHO collaborating centre for international drug monitoring in Uppsala invited Roche to comment on a potential signal of TLS in melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib. They cited 4 cases of TLS associated with vemurafenib treatment in their global ICSR database, VigiBase®. The report concluded that the information was insufficient for causality analysis, but raised concerns over the lack of clinician awareness of TLS and potential causality with vemurafenib. TLS is an uncommon but potentially fatal syndrome caused by massive tumour cell lysis. This leads to severe electrolyte abnormalities and is often accompanied by acute renal failure. TLS most often occurs after cytotoxic therapy for certain types of lymphoma and leukaemia. TLS also occurs in other tumour types that possess high proliferative rate, large tumour burden, or high sensitivity to cytotoxic therapy. In addition, TLS has been described to occur spontaneously and with other treatment modalities such as radiation and corticosteroids1. TLS in solid tumours is felt to be a rare phenomenon, and in 2010 an expert panel2 did not recommend routine TLS prophylaxis for solid tumours as the estimated risk was below 1 percent. Vemurafenib inhibits mutant BRAFV600 and is approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma (mM) harbouring this mutation. To date, there has been no described mechanistic association between the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and TLS. TLS has also not been described with dabrafenib, another BRAF inhibitor. Currently the vemurafenib reference safety information does not include TLS as an adverse drug reaction. Preclinical studies do not support an association with TLS. The literature describes TLS as rare in mM3, and there is no epidemiological assessment of the true incidence of TLS in mM. Our literature search via PubMed current as of 3 December 2014 revealed a total of 11 case reports of TLS in mM patients since 1994. All 11 cases described patients with bulky or widely metastatic disease with liver involvement. TLS was attributed to chemotherapy in 5 cases, biological therapy in 1 case, corticosteroids alone in 2 cases, radiation alone in 1 case, and occurred spontaneously in 1 case. Acute renal failure occurred in 10 patients. As of August 2014, the estimated number of patients exposed to vemurafenib was 28,809 and calculated patient-years of 17,729. The Roche Global Safety Database (RGSD) contained 6 cases of TLS, and included all 4 cases described in the WHO report. We further analysed these 6 cases by applying the case definition of TLS established by Cairo and Bishop2. The Cairo and Bishop classification of laboratory TLS stipulates that 2 or more of the following lab changes occur within 3 days before and 7 days after starting therapy. These lab changes are: hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcaemia. Clinical TLS occurs when these lab changes are accompanied by increased creatinine level, seizures, cardiac dysrhythmia, or death. All 6 cases of TLS in the RGSD were medically confirmed; 5 patients were treated with vemurafenib for mM and 1 patient for hairy cell leukaemia. These 6 cases reflect a crude reporting rate of 3.4 per 10,000 patient-years. Excluding the hairy cell leukaemia case the 5 cases involving mM reflect a crude reporting rate of 2.8 per 10,000 patient-years. Of the 6 cases, 1 case had acute renal failure and 1 case had a fatal outcome, both involving mM patients. It was unclear if the fatal outcome was associated with TLS. A quality assessment was not possible for 4 cases that failed to contain sufficient information to apply the TLS case definition. These 4 cases also failed to provide the timing of vemurafenib initiation relative to the onset of TLS and did not provide sufficient clinical information to support the diagnosis of TLS. Therefore the case definition was applied to the remaining 2 cases. The first case involved an adult female patient who was treated with vemurafenib for mM. TLS was diagnosed 5 days after vemurafenib initiation but the patient eventually recovered from the event. This case met the case definition of TLS based on laboratory abnormalities and acute renal failure. Vemurafenib was stopped on day 6 but resumed on day 22, while TLS was reported as resolved on day 58. This patient had risk factors for TLS including bulky tumour and concomitant glucocorticoid therapy. The literature contains cases of TLS in mM induced by corticosteroid therapy alone4. The second case involved an adult female patient treated with vemurafenib for mM. TLS was diagnosed 31 days after vemurafenib initiation when the patient developed fevers and chills. The only laboratory results available were white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, and LDH, which were all normal. Vemurafenib was stopped on the same day but was resumed on an unspecified date and TLS was reported as resolved on day 36. This case failed to meet case definition for TLS and was notable for the unusually long latency between therapy initiation and TLS onset. We identified 6 cases of TLS in our safety database, but 4 cases lacked sufficient information for further analysis. Of the remaining 2 cases, 1 case failed to meet case definition for TLS primarily due to long latency. In the lone case that did meet the case definition for TLS, it was confounded by concomitant corticosteroids. Our overall assessment showed temporal association and a plausible mechanism of action. This signal, however, lacked statistical correlation, was not specific, and was not supported by experimental evidence or an analogous drug reaction. We found no convincing evidence in our analysis to support a causal relationship between vemurafenib and TLS at this time. Roche recognizes this signal involving TLS and vemurafenib in mM and will continue to monitor the events of TLS through routine pharmacovigilance activities. References 1. McBride A, Westervelt P.

TLS is a rare, potentially fatal syndrome caused by a sudden massive lysis of tumour tissue with severe electrolyte disturbances and threat of kidney failure as a result. TLS has classically been observed in association with chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of hematologic and lymphatic malignancies. With the arrival of new targeted drugs in oncology and their growing and important role, during the last decades TLS has increasingly begun to be reported in association with the treatment of solid tumours, including malignant melanoma. In this setting the possibility of TLS could initially be overlooked with the risk of detrimental effects for the patient. Analysis of current available information suggests that vemurafenib may cause TLS and that informing oncologists about this rare event would be of value to increase patient safety. " ;
