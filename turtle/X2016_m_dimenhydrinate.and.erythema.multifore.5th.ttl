                     OpenPVSignal:has_content "The majority of the assessed cases from Asian countries appear to be supportive of severe skin reactions after use of dimenhydrinate. This is supported by a reasonable time to onset, known genetic predisposition to SJS/ TEN of Thais, Han Chinese and Malays, and structural similarity between dimenhydrinate xanthine moiety and pamabrom, associated with EM in a case report. Furthermore, these cases were less confounded by concomitant medications and underlying conditions compared to cases from other countries. Because the predisposition is known for drugs other than dimenhydrinate, there could be a regional sensitivity to skin-related conditions that inflates the number of reports following the administration of a drug. Despite limitations, and as an adjunct to the guidance from the Thai FDA, it is advisable to inform health-care professionals in other countries as well of this suspected safety issue. Over-the-counter availability of dimenhydrinate can constitute a challenge in avoiding undesirable effects, as interaction between physicians or pharmacists and patients is reduced in favour of access to treatment, underlining the role of pharmacovigilance centres in communicating the responsible use of medicines and the availability of other antihistamines." ;

                    OpenPVSignal:has_content "Two case series have been considered in this assessment. In the first one, SJS cases were grouped by country of origin to highlight features such as differences in demographics, time to onset, co-reported medications and adverse event terms. The second case series involved patients who were reported to have experienced EM. Stevens Johnson Syndrome patients from Thailand or Malaysia were overall treated for mild conditions or were taking fewer drugs than those from the rest of the world. In the cases where paracetamol or paracetamol combinations, known to be associated with SJS, were reported as concomitant, dimenhydrinate was considered as suspected instead. Although the two drugs were taken during the same time interval, reporter suspicion indicates that a role of dimenhydrinate cannot be completely excluded. In one instance, only paracetamol was considered a suspected drug and along with carbamazepine it would appear to be a more likely explanation for SJS. Other co-reported drugs are known to cause SJS such as albendazole, norfloxacin, cloxacillin, bromhexine; additionally, antibiotics indicate active infection, which can predispose to SJS. These confounded cases are a small minority of the total (4/33). Furthermore, nine patients recovered on dechallenge, six of whom were not taking any co-suspect or were being treated with concomitants known to induce SJS. Because the condition is known to occur within the first two months of treatment, a time to onset with an average of 2.5 days and a maximum of 29 appears to be within reasonable limits of a drug-induced effect. This is further strengthened by the positive rechallenge reported. On the other hand, although SJS occurrence after short latency has been registered,14 the time to onset in this case series seems atypical when compared to the average 2-3 weeks.15 Previous use of dimenhydrinate or NSAIDs may have fostered the occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions. Patients from other, non-Asian countries, were generally being treated for chronic conditions or infections, with an average of 16 drugs per patient. Aside from the potential interactions arising from over-medication and the underlying conditions, such as infections, in nearly every case (11/16), the dimenhydrinate contribution remains hard to assess due to allopurinol (2 cases), anti-epileptics known to rarely cause SJS (carbamazepine, lamotrigine and phenytoin) and NSAIDs – though very rarely associated with this reaction.16 Only one case is indicative of a dimenhydrinate-induced SJS; it involves a 22- year-old female who was hospitalized, and later died, due to SJS/TEN after the prescription of dimenhydrinate a month earlier. Erythema multiforme patients were treated for minor ailments, mostly allergies and sleep disturbances. Only three of them were taking paracetamol but it was reported as concomitant. Reporter suspicion should be weighed carefully before dismissing dimenhydrinate as a potential contributive agent in these cases. Except for one case, where mefenamic acid, labelled for erythema multiforme, was co-suspect, dimenhydrinate was always the only suspected drug and the only one reported in 12 cases. Among these 12 cases, there were six recoveries (with or without sequelae) on dechallenge, and one positive rechallenge with recovery on dechallenge. With an average time to onset of 1.8 days, in keeping with a drug-induced EM, there is a strong hint of a causal role of dimenhydrinate, although such a short time to onset is atypical for EM. Stevens Johnson Syndrome and erythema multiforme are two skin conditions known to be drug-induced in many cases. Recent findings have shown Chinese, Thais and Malays to be more prone to developing these reactions, especially with allopurinol as the causative agent. Interestingly, the large majority of the patients in the two case series considered were Thai, which could indicate regional specificity or may be related to usage. It should be noted however, that these patients were not affected by chronic conditions, infections or taking multiple drugs, at least in the majority of the cases, unlike patients from other countries. Tan and Sklar13 suggested the 8- bromotheophylline moiety to have been responsible for erythema multiforme, and similarly it could be postulated that the 8- chlorotheophylline component in dimenhydrinate might have played a role in the development of either SJS or EM. In fact, both molecules are identical in their xanthine group and differ only in the halogen in position 8 (bromine or chlorine). Although there is no evidence that correlates xanthines with SJS or EM, there are two case reports of theophylline, another xanthine, and severe erythema multiforme and SJS.17,18 There are some limitations to this assessment. As the predisposition to SJS/EM in some Asian populations is well-described, physicians could be more prone to diagnosing SJS/EM, or more inclined to report it. Thailand is, in VigiBase®, the main contributor to Continental Asia reports when it comes to these skin conditions (48% of Continental Asia reports) and Continental Asia adds 30% of the total reports with the MedDRA PT Stevens Johnson Syndrome alone, which may point to a reporting bias. Based on the limited number of reports indicating seriousness, it might seem that a majority of the cases were not considered serious. Important to note is that most of the cases were reported to VigiBase® in a format in which seriousness cannot be reported in a structured way. However, out of the 13 reports where seriousness could be reported, 11 actually indicated a serious reaction. Unreported seriousness can lead to speculations around the nature of the diagnosis. Skin detachment is a medical concern that often results in hospitalization, which is one of the criteria for being considered a serious reaction. Limitations in the reporting format also account for interpretative issues in regards to the outcomes of drug discontinuation (for instance, cases reporting positive dechallenge but outcome not recovered)." ;

Its structure is composed of a diphenhydramine and an 8- chlorotheophylline moiety. The former is the true antihistamine, while the latter – a stimulant – acts as buffer against sedating effects. Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is a potentially fatal, immune-mediated condition, characterized by epidermal necrosis without dermal inflammation. Acute symptoms are skin, mucosae and eye lesions, fever and sore throat. Typically, SJS is perceived as a drug-induced effect; the most common drugs associated with it are antibiotics (sulfonamides in particular), HIV antiretroviral treatment, carbamazepine or aromatic anticonvulsants, allopurinol and NSAIDs (-oxicam type).1 Erythema multiforme (EM) is divided in two categories: minor and major. The latter is characterized by mucosal involvement in addition to target lesions, and is often drug-induced.2 Patients are at a higher risk of developing SJS during the first two months of treatment with the aforementioned drugs.3 The human leukocyte antigen (HLA-) B*1502 has been identified as a positive predictor of genetic susceptibility to carbamazepine-induced SJS in Han Chinese, Malays and Thais. Additionally, HLA-B*5801 positive Chinese4 and Thai5 are considered to be predisposed to drug-induced SJS. A strong association between HLA-B*1502 and severe skin reactions has not been identified in large-scale studies involving Europeans6 , as opposed to HLA-B*5801, where allopurinol and aromatic antidepressants were the most commonly involved drugs.7 There are a number of conditions associated with SJS/EM, such as infections, namely herpes simplex infection and AIDS, as well as chronic pulmonary inflammatory conditions." ;

However, a communication was issued this June by the Thai FDA that urges caution when using dimenhydrinate, due to severe skin reactions, including SJS, TEN and fixed drug eruption.11 A review of the literature highlighted two case reports of interest. The first one involves a young Iranian man, aged 17, who repeatedly complained of symptoms of SJS after administration of dimenhydrinate for motion sickness. The boy took the drug at least three times, in two instances the symptoms were mild, self-limiting and not systemic. However, in the third and last instance there appeared genital and mouth ulcers along with systemic reactions (itching, redness). The diagnosis of SJS was confirmed by biopsy and after a recommendation to avoid dimenhydrinate and a one-year follow-up there was no reoccurrence of the reaction.12 The second case concerns a 22-year-old female from China. The woman suffered from periorbital oedema and generalized rash after dimenhydrinate administration, worsening to erythema multiforme after treatment with chlorphenamine and hydroxyzine. On two occasions, she had taken paracetamol and pamabrom (8- bromotheophylline) and suffered from similar episodes. Allergic tests for paracetamol yielded negative results. The authors concluded that the theophylline moiety (pamabrom and 8- chlorotheophylline) may have triggered the reaction, because the patient had taken diphenhydramine and paracetamol separately on other occasions without any consequences.13" ;

As of October 2015 there were, after removal of suspected duplicates, 49 cases of dimenhydrinate in association with the MedDRA Preferred Term Stevens Johnson Syndrome in VigiBase®, the WHO international database of suspected adverse drug reactions. They come from Thailand (32), Germany (14), Malaysia, Suriname and Canada (one each). The combination was highlighted with an IC of 2.52 and an IC025 of 2.10. Reports have been subdivided into two groups, based on country of origin of the reports. South-East Asian reports These 33 patients were mostly female (female to male ratio of 26:7) and had an average age of 56.1 years (median 64.0), ranging from 5 to 86 years. The time to onset was reported in 31 cases, and averaged around 2.5 days (median 1 day), with a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 29 days. The seriousness was not reported for these cases. The indication was nausea or dizziness in eight cases and fever in one. Dimenhydrinate was the only suspected drug in 25 cases out of 33 and the only one reported in 13. Other co-suspects included anti-muscarinics to treat diarrhoea, antihelminthics such as albendazole, other antihistamines (chlorphenamine, cinnarizine, cyproheptadine, flunarizine), anti-nausea agents (metoclopramide), antibiotics (norfloxacin, cloxacillin) and in one case carbamazepine and paracetamol. Sixteen patients were taking other concomitants, including paracetamol alone or in combination with orphenadrine in eight cases, other antihistamines (flunarizine, chlorphenamine, loratadine, cetirizine, cyproheptadine), vitamins of the B complex, dexamethasone, gastroprotectants (domperidone, omeprazole), cough remedies (bromehexine, dextromethorphan), antibiotics (levofloxacin) and antihypertensives (amlodipine, simvastatin). Patients were generally taking one to three drugs. Only terms belonging to a clinical picture of Stevens Johnson Syndrome, such as Stevens Johnson Syndrome, rash, pruritus, and fever were reported and in one case exclusively EM was coreported. Dimenhydrinate was withdrawn in 18 cases, the reaction abated in 13 cases but no effect was observed in five. When the reaction abated, the outcome was noted as ‘recovered’ or ‘recovered with sequelae’ in nine patients, not recovered in two and unknown in two. Where no effect was observed, the outcome was recovered and recovered with sequelae in two, not recovered in two and unknown in one. No information on dechallenge was provided for the remaining 15 cases. The outcome of these cases was recovered or recovered with sequelae in seven, not recovered in six and unknown in two. One positive rechallenge (with no information on dechallenge) was reported, the outcome of this case was not recovered at the time of reporting. In the 13 cases where dimenhydrinate was the only reported drug, the average time to onset was 3.4 days with a median of 0 days. When the reaction abated, the outcome was noted as ‘recovered’ or ‘recovered with sequelae’ in nine patients, ‘not recovered’ in two and unknown in two. In the remaining nine cases, it is unknown whether the drug was discontinued, however, the outcome was reported in seven: three patients fully recovered, while four had not recovered at the time of reporting. The case with positive rechallenge described above was included in this set of reports. Other countries’ reports Among the 16 cases there were more females than males (female to male ratio of 10:6), with an average of 56.8-years (median 70). Time to onset was reported in 13 cases, it was of 6.4 days on average (median of 5.5), with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 18 days. There were ten serious cases, one non-serious and five in which seriousness was not reported. Two cases coreported toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Dimenhydrinate was the only suspected drug in two cases, other co-suspects were antiinflammatory/antipyretics or chronic pain treatments (opiates, -coxibs, NSAIDs) in 11 cases, antibiotics in 11 cases (penicillins, cephalosporins and “sulfa” antibiotics), anticoagulants in nine (such as acetylsalicylic acid or heparins), sedatives (benzodiazepines, Valeriana officinalis) in seven cases, anti-hypertensive and/or diuretics in seven, anti-epilepsy medication in three (carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine) and gout treatment in two (allopurinol, colchicine). On average, patients in this cohort were taking around 16 medications. Only one case was reported with no co-suspects and no concomitants. There were other conditions, such as chronic heart failure, constipation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, angina pectoris, migraine, osteoporosis and cancer. Co-reported adverse reaction terms mostly belonged to a clinical picture of SJS and were: fever, skin discoloration, erythema and macules, as well as mucosal involvement (of the lip, nose and eyes) or blistering. Urinary tract infection and TEN were each also reported in one case. In three cases the reaction abated after drug withdrawal (although dimenhydrinate was never withdrawn alone), in one the reaction was fatal
despite withdrawal, while another patient was rechallenged with unknown outcome. The outcome of the reaction was recovered/recovering in eight cases, fatal in two and not recovered in three. In one of the two fatal cases, SJS was attributed to pantoprazole and to the patient’s cholangitis. The remaining fatal case concerns a young woman who was hospitalized due to SJS after about a month of dimenhydrinate use (the reported time to onset was of 0 days).
 Erythema multiforme 
The cases associated with the MedDRA PT Erythema multiforme were 24, the majority of which came once again from Thailand (22 cases) while one case each came from Iran and the Republic of Korea. The combination of dimenhydrinate and EM had an IC of 1.90 and an IC025 of 1.28. Twenty patients were females, while the rest were males. The average age was 59 years (median of 62), with a minimum of 25 and a maximum of 80 years. Time to onset was reported in 22 cases, being 1.8 days on average (median of 1), with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 11 days. One case was reported as serious, while seriousness information was missing for the rest of the reports. In all cases but one dimenhydrinate was the only suspected drug, while in 12 it was the only one reported. Concomitant medications were reported in 12 cases; among the most frequent there were antihistamines, such as cinnarizine, flunarizine and chlorphenamine, in five cases, NSAIDs such as paracetamol and acetylsalicylic acid in three, benzodiazepines in another three cases and vitamins in two. Other co-reported drugs were acid neutralizers, antidiabetics, etilefrine, pentoxyfylline, prednisolone, but were reported only once. Patients were generally taking one or two drugs, with one patient taking four. The drug was withdrawn in 15 cases, in 12 the reaction abated, while in three no effect was observed. There were two positive rechallenges. When the drug was withdrawn and the reaction abated the outcome was recovered, recovered with sequelae and not recovered in four cases each. When there was no effect after withdrawal, the outcome was always ‘not recovered’. The outcome of the two cases with positive rechallenge was recovery and recovery with sequelae. Only three cases co-reported other adverse events: drug eruption, dermatitis bullous and pruritus. In one case the original reported term was “erythema multiforme severe”.""" ;

                OpenPVSignal:has_content "Dimenhydrinate is the 8-chlorotheophylline diphenhydramine derivative used as symptomatic treatment in allergies, motion sickness or nausea. As of October 2015, there were 73 cases for the MedDRA preferred terms Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and erythema multiforme (EM) in association with dimenhydrinate in VigiBase®, the WHO international database of suspected adverse drug reactions. The two drug-event combinations were disproportionately highlighted, with respective IC values of 2.52 and 1.90. There appears to be grounds for a signal specific to Asian patients, in the light of known sensitivity to severe skin reactions in this population, a reasonable time to onset, the similarity to case reports documented in the literature, and reoccurrence of reactions after re-exposure. Furthermore, the theophylline moiety of dimenhydrinate may play a role in the onset of SJS/EM. Despite limitations, such as potential reporting bias and reporting format constraints, there appears to be a signal for dimenhydrinate and severe skin reactions. As an adjunct to recent guidance from the Thai FDA, it is advisable to inform health-care professionals in other countries as well of this suspected safety issue. " ;

In fact, both molecules are identical in their xanthine group and differ only in the halogen in position 8 (bromine or chlorine). Although there is no evidence that correlates xanthines with SJS or EM, there are two case reports of theophylline, another xanthine, and severe erythema multiforme and SJS.17,18" ;

Only three of them were taking paracetamol but it was reported as concomitant. Reporter suspicion should be weighed carefully before dismissing dimenhydrinate as a potential contributive agent in these cases. Except for one case, where mefenamic acid, labelled for erythema multiforme, was co-suspect, dimenhydrinate was always the only suspected drug and the only one reported in 12 cases. Among these 12 cases, there were six recoveries (with or without sequelae) on dechallenge, and one positive rechallenge with recovery on dechallenge. With an average time to onset of 1.8 days, in keeping with a drug-induced EM, there is a strong hint of a causal role of dimenhydrinate, although such a short time to onset is atypical for EM" ;

The first one involves a young Iranian man, aged 17, who repeatedly complained of symptoms of SJS after administration of dimenhydrinate for motion sickness. The boy took the drug at least three times, in two instances the symptoms were mild, self-limiting and not systemic. However, in the third and last instance there appeared genital and mouth ulcers along with systemic reactions (itching, redness). The diagnosis of SJS was confirmed by biopsy and after a recommendation to avoid dimenhydrinate and a one-year follow-up there was no re-occurrence of the reaction.12 The second case concerns a 22-year-old female from China. The woman suffered from periorbital oedema and generalized rash after dimenhydrinate administration, worsening to erythema multiforme after treatment with chlorphenamine and hydroxyzine. On two occasions, she had taken paracetamol and pamabrom (8- bromotheophylline) and suffered from similar episodes. Allergic tests for paracetamol yielded negative results. The authors concluded that the theophylline moiety (pamabrom and 8- chlorotheophylline) may have triggered the reaction, because the patient had taken diphenhydramine and paracetamol separately on other occasions without any consequences.13" ;
