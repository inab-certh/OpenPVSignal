A widened search in VigiBase® revealed 444 reports for the PT injection site vesicles. The 31 reports originate from the United States, the United Kingdom and Colombia. The majority of these patients were receiving treatment for rheumatoid arthritis; psoriatic arthropathy and psoriasis were other reported indications. Among the co-reported terms were rash and pain. Seven cases described systemic symptoms such as oedema generalized, influenza like symptoms or nausea. Two cases coreported injection technique errors and two injection site infections. One third of the cases provided additional details where the reaction was described as manifesting with nodules, welts or vesicles. In particular, one patient developed extensive erythema covered in small open sores and another experienced multiple ulcers that developed between calves and ankles at both legs. Reactions manifested from one week to five years after therapy was started where this information was provided, occurring within one month in the majority of cases. In six of these cases, the event occurred shortly or within two days after the injection was given, with one patient experiencing the event after each injection. Etanercept was the only suspected drug in all cases save one where infliximab was also suspected. Two cases are unlikely to be related to etanercept, as in one the reaction occurred at a shingle vaccine injection site, and in the other the reaction occurred before the therapy was started." ;

                      OpenPVSignal:has_content """The Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) invited Pfizer, as the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) for etanercept (Enbrel®) in Europe, to comment on a proposed communication from the UMC regarding a signal of injection site ulceration/ injection site necrosis in patients treated with etanercept. Pfizer agrees with the UMC that injection site reactions (ISRs) are well characterised and reported as very common adverse reactions associated with etanercept therapy, occurring at a frequency of ≥ 1/10.1 The local symptoms of ISRs are usually mild, including bleeding at the puncture site, bruising, erythema, itching, pain or swelling, and are generally transient and do not recur with treatment.1 In fact, less than 1.5% of ISR events reported to Pfizer as postmarketing cases are classified as serious, and less than 0.02% of events of ISRs reported from clinical trials are considered to be serious adverse events. A cumulative search of Pfizer’s safety database up to 18 April 2016 for the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Terms (PTs) Injection site ulcer and Injection site necrosis identified 39 and 7 cases, respectively. These 46 cases represent less than 0.04% of all cases of ISRs reported to Pfizer. Of these, 13 cases were reported as serious, representing less than 0.15% of all reported serious cases of ISRs. Pfizer expects, but cannot confirm, that there is significant overlap with the 31 cases retrieved for the search of the same PTs performed by the UMC in VigiBase® (WHO Global ICSR database). The majority of cases in Pfizer’s safety database were reported from the United States, with 1 case from the United Kingdom, and no cases reported from Colombia. Additional countries reporting cases to Pfizer include Argentina, Brazil, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland. A review of these cases showed minimal relevant information including lack of information on diagnosis, treatment, concomitant medications, and descriptive information regarding the manifestations of the ISRs. The review did not reveal any cases which described suspected or confirmed cutaneous vasculitis. Pfizer is of the view that the causes of serious ISRs are likely multifactorial. Hypersensitivity, infection due to improper injection technique or device failure, and cutaneous vasculitis have been described as potential causes. A small study that assessed biopsy data from etanercept-associated ISRs suggested T-lymphocyte mediated delayed type hypersensitivity reactions, with eventual induction of tolerance, as a possible mechanism of action.2 While cutaneous vasculitis is listed as a rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) adverse reaction for etanercept,1 the currently available evidence in Pfizer’s safety database does not suggest that events reported as injection site ulceration or injection site necrosis are due to cutaneous vasculitis. Pfizer strongly agrees that patient training in the use of proper injection technique to prevent infections that could lead to serious ISRs is very important. To this end, Pfizer maintains extensive region-specific educational programs, which differ according to individual market requirements. These programs for patients and health-care providers support the use of proper injection technique and include visual teaching guides, demonstration devices, and instructional materials in both print and video format. They also include a toll free number and website for patient assistance and questions in many regions. Pfizer continues regular pharmacovigilance surveillance monitoring of the important risk of ISRs through review of postmarketing data, clinical trial data, and published literature. Pfizer acknowledges UMC’s additional characterisation of ISRs and seeks further clarification through 
ongoing surveillance with a particular focus on identifying any causes for which the risk can be mitigated through increased awareness and patient and physician education.

This analysis focused on the WHO-ART preferred term (PT) ‘injection site ulceration’ and was then extended to the adjacent PT ‘injection site necrosis’, as they are a related phenomenon. Etanercept is a recombinant receptor inhibitor for the Tumour Necrosis Factor and it is indicated as an immunomodulator for the treatment of both primary and secondary arthritis in adults.1 Etanercept injection site reactions are well documented and characterised2; they are usually mild, including bleeding, bruising, erythema, itching, pain or swelling, and injection site ulcerations are not mentioned; these reactions usually occur within one month but recall injection site reactions can also occur at the most recent site of injection. In addition, serious skin reactions such as cutaneous vasculitis are also mentioned in the product information.1 In general, injection site ulcerations can be due to either an improper injection technique that may result in infection and consequently to ulceration or to the drug itself via different mechanisms. As an example, immunomodulators injected intramuscularly have been reported as causing necrotizing vasculitis.3 Serious skin reactions at the injection site represent a complication that may lead to therapy discontinuation: this notice aims to report cases of injection site ulceration and to characterize more accurately etanercept-induced injection site reactions." ;
