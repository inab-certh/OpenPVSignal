Time to onset is consistent with a drug induced effect. Dechallenge is very supportive of a drug association with all patients recovered or recovering on withdrawal of febuxostat although there were other suspected drugs for which a positive dechallenge was also present. Allergic vasculitis is not mentioned in the product information for febuxostat but it does refer to a wide range of skin reactions and it also notes that rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat, some of which were associated to systemic symptoms, have occurred in the postmarketing experience. Moreover, there is a report in the literature in which a patient developed biopsy-confirmed cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, likely but not definitively febuxostatrelated. " ;

                   OpenPVSignal:has_content "Case reports in VigiBase® suggest that there is a possible signal for the association of febuxostat and vasculitis allergic. Febuxostat was the only drug suspected in one of the seven cases. There were other drugs suspected in the remaining six cases. In Case 1, the combination of colchicine, tiemonium methylsulfate and Papaver somniferum was also suspected and although it was withdrawn with recovery (as was febuxostat), it had been used for two months longer and there is no reference to vasculitis in the product information.

In the product information for hydroxycarbamide there is no specific reference to allergic vasculitis but cutaneous vasculitis is mentioned.6 However, in view of the long usage of hydroxycarbamide, febuxostat appears a more likely cause in this case. In Case 3, allopurinol was also suspected and although the dates of use are unclear it appears that only febuxostat was withdrawn. In the product information for allopurinol, there is no specific reference to allergic vasculitis but there is a warning concerning hypersensitivity reactions and a reference that associated vasculitis and tissue response may be manifested in various ways.7 However, in view of the response to withdrawal of febuxostat while allopurinol was continued, febuxostat appears a more likely cause in this case. In Case 4, influenza vaccine was also suspected. Influenza vaccine was only used once so there is no possibility of assessing a response to withdrawal but recovery did occur on withdrawal of febuxostat. For influenza vaccine, there is no specific reference to allergic vasculitis but the product information for at least one influenza vaccine notes that vasculitis has been associated in very rare cases with transient renal involvement.8 Again, the response to withdrawal makes febuxostat a more likely cause in this case.

The outcome of the allergic vasculitis was stated in all seven reports. All of these patients were reported as recovered or recovering and febuxostat was withdrawn in all cases. As noted above, however, other suspected drugs were also withdrawn at the same time as febuxostat. Nevertheless, the response to dechallenge in all cases is strongly suggestive of a febuxostat related effect. As noted above, there is one report in the literature in which febuxostat was associated with cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis in which the authors suggested that febuxostat was likely related." ;

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content "Febuxostat is a 2-arylthiazole derivative that achieves its therapeutic effect of decreasing serum uric acid by selectively inhibiting xanthine oxidase (XO). Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans and is generated in the cascade of hypoxanthine being converted to xanthine and xanthine converted to uric acid. Both steps in the above transformations are catalyzed by XO. Febuxostat is indicated for the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in conditions where urate deposition has already occurred (including a history, or presence of, tophus and/or gouty arthritis). The most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials and post-marketing experience are gout flares, liver function abnormalities, diarrhoea, nausea, headache, arthralgia, rash and oedema. These adverse reactions were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Rare serious hypersensitivity reactions to febuxostat, some of which were associated with systemic symptoms, have occurred in the postmarketing experience. Adverse skin reactions reported include rash (common), dermatitis, urticaria, pruritus, skin discolouration, skin lesion, petechiae, rash macular, rash maculopapular and rash papular (uncommon) and toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens Johnson syndrome, angioedema, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, generalized rash, erythema, exfoliative rash, rash follicular, rash vesicular, rash pustular, rash pruritic, rash erythematous, rash morbillifom, alopecia and hyperhidrosis (rare).1 Vasculitis comprises a heterogeneous group of inflammatory vascular lesions that can involve any kind of blood vessel, irrespective of its lumen or location. Vasculitis gives rise to such conditions as ischaemia or thrombosis, which may cause serious organ damage and be life-threatening. Vasculitis is a necrotizing inflammatory lesion of blood vessels, leading to their occlusion or disruption, with clinical sequelae. The clinicopathological diagnosis of vasculitis is supported by the demonstration of elevated levels of acute-phase reactants (demonstrated by, for example, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, differential blood count showing thrombocytosis and leukocytosis, and Creactive protein), high levels of rheumatoid factors and cryoglobulins, hypocomplementaemia, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) especially those ANCAs directed against proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase.2 Allergic vasculitis, also known as hypersensitivity vasculitis, is an acute form of this condition that is marked by inflammation or redness of the skin that occurs when contact is made with an irritating substance. It is characterized by the appearance of red spots on the skin, most commonly, palpable purpura. Palpable purpura are raised spots that are usually red in colour but may darken to a purple colour. However, there are many other types of rashes that can occur. Causes of skin inflammation include medications, infections or any other foreign object which may induce an allergic reaction.3 Hypersensitivity vasculitis is usually represented histopathologically as leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) which is a term commonly used to denote a small vessel vasculitis. Hypersensitivity vasculitis is thought to be mediated by immune complex deposition. In this form of vasculitis, circulating antigens in the body (produced by factors such as medications, infections, and neoplasms) induce antibody formation. These antibodies bind to the circulating antigen and create immune complexes, which then deposit within vessels, activating complement and inducing inflammatory mediators. Inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, and local factors may affect the endothelial cells and may play a role in the manifestations of this disease.4 It should be noted that in MedDRA, the preferred term is hypersensitivity vasculitis with allergic vasculitis and leukocytoclastic vasculitis as lower level terms. In WHO-ART vasculitis allergic is an included term along with leukocytoclastic vasculitis with vasculitis as the preferred term. The more commonly used term, allergic vasculitis, will be used throughout this article." ;

In the opinion of the authors, this occurrence early in treatment mandates caution, careful dose escalation, and close monitoring when febuxostat urate-lowering therapy is considered.5" ;

In this form of vasculitis, circulating antigens in the body (produced by factors such as medications, infections, and neoplasms) induce antibody formation. These antibodies bind to the circulating antigen and create immune complexes, which then deposit within vessels, activating complement and inducing inflammatory mediators. Inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, and local factors may affect the endothelial cells and may play a role in the manifestations of this disease" ;

After the elimination of one suspected duplicate, the reports were submitted from Germany (2 reports), the United States (2), France, India and Japan (1 report each). The patients ranged in age from 48 to 85 years but six of the patients were aged 70 years or over with a median of 75 years. There were four males and three females. Febuxostat was the only drug suspected in one of the seven cases. There were other drugs also suspected in the remaining six cases including the combination of colchicine, tiemonium methylsulfate and Papaver somniferum (opium poppy) in one report, hydroxycarbamide, allopurinol, influenza vaccine and levofloxacin, all in one report each, and moxifloxacin, phenprocoumon and torasemide in the remaining report. Concomitant drugs were reported in six of the seven cases and apart from the use of corticosteroids, antihypertensives and drugs for the treatment of pain in two cases each, the concomitant drugs were used to treat a variety of conditions. Febuxostat was reported to have been administered orally, as expected, in all seven cases. Dosage was reported in five cases and was 40 mg daily in three reports and 80 mg daily in the other two reports. The indication for use was stated in six reports and included gout in three reports and hyperuricaemia in three reports. Time to onset was reported in three of the reports and ranged from the same day the drug was administered to 18 days (median 14 days). The outcome of the allergic vasculitis was stated in all seven reports. All of these patients were reported as recovered or recovering on withdrawal of febuxostat. Other reactions were reported in four of the seven cases. These included other skin reactions including skin exfoliation in two cases, renal and urinary disorders in two cases and a small number of other reactions." ;

                OpenPVSignal:has_content "Febuxostat is a 2-arylthiazole derivative that achieves its therapeutic effect of decreasing serum uric acid by selectively inhibiting xanthine oxidase (XO). Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans and is generated in the cascade of hypoxanthine being converted to xanthine and xanthine converted to uric acid. Both steps in the above transformations are catalyzed by XO. Febuxostat is indicated for the treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in conditions where urate deposition has already occurred (including a history, or presence of, tophus and/or gouty arthritis). After the elimination of one suspected duplicate there are currently (1 July 2015) seven individual case safety reports in VigiBase®, the WHO international database of suspected adverse drug reactions, of allergic vasculitis in association with febuxostat. The reports are from France, Germany, India, Japan and the United States. Febuxostat was the only drug suspected in one of the seven cases. The outcome of the allergic vasculitis was stated in all seven cases and in all cases the patients had either recovered or were recovering after the withdrawal of febuxostat. Case reports in VigiBase® suggest that there is a possible signal for the association of febuxostat and allergic vasculitis. Although there were other drugs suspected in six of the seven reports, febuxostat appears to be the most likely explanation in four of the six reports and a possible cause in the remaining two reports, as well as in the report where it was the only suspected drug. Time to onset is consistent with a drug induced effect. Dechallenge is very supportive of a drug association with all patients recovered or recovering on withdrawal of febuxostat although there were other suspected drugs for which a positive dechallenge was also present. In addition, there is a report in the literature in which a patient developed biopsyconfirmed cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, likely but not definitively febuxostat-related." ;

Vasculitis gives rise to such conditions as ischaemia or thrombosis, which may cause serious organ damage and be life-threatening. Vasculitis is a necrotizing inflammatory lesion of blood vessels, leading to their occlusion or disruption, with clinical sequelae. The clinicopathological diagnosis of vasculitis is supported by the demonstration of elevated levels of acute-phase reactants (demonstrated by, for example, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, differential blood count showing thrombocytosis and leukocytosis, and C-reactive protein), high levels of rheumatoid factors and cryoglobulins, hypocomplementaemia, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) especially those ANCAs directed against proteinase 3 or myeloperoxidase.2 Allergic vasculitis, also known as hypersensitivity vasculitis, is an acute form of this condition that is marked by inflammation or redness of the skin that occurs when contact is made with an irritating substance. It is characterized by the appearance of red spots on the skin, most commonly, palpable purpura. Palpable purpura are raised spots that are usually red in colour but may darken to a purple colour. However, there are many other types of rashes that can occur. Causes of skin inflammation include medications, infections or any other foreign object which may induce an allergic reaction.3 Hypersensitivity vasculitis is usually represented histopathologically as leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) which is a term commonly used to denote a small vessel vasculitis. Hypersensitivity vasculitis is thought to be mediated by immune complex deposition. In this form of vasculitis, circulating antigens in the body (produced by factors such as medications, infections, and neoplasms) induce antibody formation. These antibodies bind to the circulating antigen and create immune complexes, which then deposit within vessels, activating complement and inducing inflammatory mediators. Inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, and local factors may affect the endothelial cells and may play a role in the manifestations of this disease.4" ;

Furthermore the vasculitis has been analyzed in the context of the continuous safety surveillance for risk of serious skin/ hypersensitivity reactions (as mentioned in the current EU Risk Management Plan of the product). In the signal evaluation of this signal in gout patients, the fact that uric acid per se could be an activator of the immune system, should be kept in consideration (Rheumatology 2010;49:1229- 1238). Since the market authorization of the product, 10 cases describing “vasculitis” events were collected, including a study case where the therapy used is still blinded and another case describing “HenochSchonlein” purpura. The reports are from Germany (2 cases), France (2 cases), USA (6 cases) and Japan (1 case) and are summarized in table 1. Most of collected “vasculitis” reports present confounding factors, with co-morbid conditions, and other co-suspect medications. Additionally, some of these reports have insufficient information for causality assessment. Therefore current data do not allow establishing a causal relationship with febuxostat. The issue has been further analyzed in a Safety Update Report to EU regulators (up to 20 April 2015) and as of November 2015, the conclusion of the European Authority (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee - PRAC) has been that the signal leukocytoclastic vasculitis could be closed as a refuted signal due to small number of cases and confounding factors. Conclusions On the base of the available data, it is not possible to establish a causal relationship between “vasculitis” and febuxostat and the risk profile of febuxostat remains unchanged at this time. In agreement with the European Authority (PRAC), this potential signal leukocytoclastic vasculitis has been closed as a refuted signal. The MAHs will continue to monitor all relevant benefit-risk information and will take appropriate action if any new information emerges that would affect the safety profile of febuxostat." ;
