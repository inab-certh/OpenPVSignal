ARF can be classified as: prerenal ARF with diminishing circulating arterial volume caused by conditions such as dehydration, sepsis and cardiac failure; or intrinsic renal ARF with renal parenchymal damage resulting from glomerulonephritis, rhabdomyolysis, acute interstitial nephritis; or postrenal ARF with obstruction to the urinary tract from for example tumors or posterior urethral valves. Medicines can negatively affect the renal function directly by reducing the blood flow, or indirectly by inducing for example allergic reactions to the renal tissues. Examples of nephrotoxic medicines that are known to cause ARF are aminoglycosides, acetaminophen, cisplatin, lithium, and vancomycin. Medicines known to induce interstitial nephritis are antimicrobials (e.g. cephalosporins, penicillins and sulphonamides), NSAIDs, diuretics and certain anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin). Topiramate is an example of a medicine inducing nephrolithiasis.2" ;

The cases had a reasonable time to onset (3, 5, 4, 17 days) and a positive dechallenge, but levetiracetam was co-reported with drugs known to cause renal problems. One case started and stopped aciclovir during the same dates as levetiracetam. In the second case, the creatinine values peaked when the doses were highest for the suspect drugs levetiracetam, topiramate, and thiopental, and started to decrease when topiramate was withdrawn, followed by a continuous decrease after stopping levetiracetam and thiopental some days later. The third case was a 7-week-old premature baby with a complex history, who recovered from increased creatinine levels three weeks after levetiracetam had been stopped and one week after dose reduction of meropenem, which is listed with renal disorders. The fourth case was a published case reporting a suspected interaction between methotrexate and levetiracetam and where the time to onset for levetiracetam was uncertain but most likely three days.5 In two reports, the increased creatinine and renal impairment was most probably the secondary event to DRESS syndrome (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms), which is listed in the product information for levetiracetam.1 These cases had additional co-suspected AEDs: phenytoin, lacosamide and valproic acid, also known to be reported with DRESS-syndrome." ;

More than 100 reports with levetiracetam and ARF and/or interstitial nephritis have been reported to VigiBase® and several related published cases have been highlighted in the literature.4,5,8,9,12 The high number of reports in itself creates a suspicion of a possible nephrotoxic effect from levetiracetam. However, in many of the evaluated VigiBase® reports, levetiracetam was reported with other co-suspect drugs known to cause nephrotoxicity. The reported ARF was part of a more complex disease process in many of the reports, such as rhabdomyolysis in association with status epilepticus, and DRESS-syndrome. When it comes to the quality of data, duplication of reports was a particular obstacle in the assessment of these reports. More than 50 duplicate reports were found among the evaluated reports that to a large extent were generated from three published case reports, and there might be more duplicates among the unassessed adult cases. However, in nine of the 39 evaluated unique reports, we found support for at least a possible causal relationship between levetiracetam and impaired renal function.
ARF was reported more frequently than expected for adolescents (12-17 years) and young adults (18-44 years). However, the IC in the adolescent age group is most likely driven by the high number of duplicates from the 17-year-old and 12-year-old published cases.4,8 Reports with levetiracetam and interstitial nephritis was reported more frequently than expected based on the overall reporting in VigiBase®, although this case series also included many duplicates.
ARF is not a well-defined reaction but support for a more specific event was found for interstitial nephritis, reported for some of the ARF cases and also singly in the reports under assessment. The short time to onset for some of the cases suggests an allergic response to the drug, which supports the case of interstitial nephritis. Possible toxicity to the renal tubules in connection to levetiracetam- induced hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia was suggested in a published case,11 additional to this reviewed case series. In the evaluated VigiBase® reports in this assessment, there was no mentioning of kidney stone formation but more so of allergic nephritis or interstitial nephritis.
A temporal relationship was reasonable in most reports where a time to onset could be calculated. The time to onset ranged from one day to two months among the nine cases that supported a possible relationship. The time to onset of two months related to a case with increasing dose during this time period.9
Experimental evidence for this signal was supported by several cases from VigiBase® and the literature where the renal impairment improved after the drug had been withdrawn and where some reports described normal creatinine before start of levetiracetam, followed by an increase after treatment and a decrease when levetiracetam was withdrawn. Also, biological plausibility was suggested in cases where the increasing dose seemed to have triggered the development of the renal event.
There is insufficient information to be certain of the pathophysiology of levetiracetam toxicity on the kidney. The placebo-controlled clinical studies summarised for the Keppra product,14 with over 700 levetiracetam-treated patients, did not highlight any statistically significant laboratory findings, although in open studies abnormal values in haematocrit, haemoglobin, white blood cell counts and eosinophil counts were found.
Creatinine levels were not mentioned. These studies might however include too few patients in order to detect ARF and particularly interstitial nephritis.
It should be noted that only a subset of the 90 VigiBase® reports with ARF for adults were assessed in this review and that full details of the reports were only assessed for the paediatric reports, so additional supporting cases might exist.

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content """Levetiracetam is one of the newer generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). It is considered to be safer than many of the older AEDs. It is an effective anticonvulsant and its main adverse drug reactions are tiredness and behavioural changes. The active substance of levetiracetam is a pyrrolidone derivate. The mechanism of action is not fully elucidated but in vitro studies suggest that an interaction between levetiracetam and the synaptic vesicle protein 2A results in antiseizure activity. Levetiracetam is excreted primarily via urine by glomerular filtration followed by tubular reabsorption. Elimination of levetiracetam is correlated to creatinine clearance.1
Acute renal failure (ARF) is a life-threatening condition. Renal insufficiency is impairment of renal function that is less severe. ARF can be classified as: prerenal ARF with diminishing circulating arterial volume caused by conditions such as dehydration, sepsis and cardiac failure; or intrinsic renal ARF with renal parenchymal damage resulting from glomerulonephritis, rhabdomyolysis, acute interstitial nephritis; or postrenal ARF with obstruction to the urinary tract from for example tumors or posterior urethral valves. Medicines can negatively affect the renal function directly by reducing the blood flow, or indirectly by inducing for example allergic reactions to the renal tissues. Examples of nephrotoxic medicines that are known to cause ARF are aminoglycosides, acetaminophen, cisplatin, lithium, and vancomycin. Medicines known to induce interstitial nephritis are antimicrobials (e.g. cephalosporins, penicillins and sulphonamides), NSAIDs, diuretics and certain anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, phenytoin). Topiramate is an example of a medicine inducing nephrolithiasis.2""" ;

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content "Up to February 2015, and before exclusion of duplicates, the WHO Global database of Individual Case Safety Reports, VigiBase® included 35 reports for children (0-17 years) with levetiracetam and the WHO adverse reaction terminology (ART) preferred terms (PT) ‘Renal failure acute’ (n=29); ‘Azotaemia’ with the included term ‘Creatinine blood increased’ (n=1); and ‘Renal function abnormal’ with the included term ‘Renal impairment’ (n=5). Original reports were used in the evaluation of the reports issued for children. A total of 90 reports for adults (≥ 18 years), including reports where age was unspecified, with PT ‘Renal failure acute’ were retrieved, of which 12 reports were well-documented, according to vigiGrade3 (score > 0.80), and further assessed in-depth. The PT ‘Nephritis interstitial’ was co-reported in some of the reports, so a separate analysis was made on these 49 reports with any ages. Disproportionality For levetiracetam and ‘Renal failure acute’, the lower limit of the 95% credibility interval of the Information Component (IC025) was positive for the subgroups of ages 12-17 years (IC=2.28; IC025=1.63) and 18-44 years (IC=1.05; IC025=0.59), which constituted the age groups with most reports for this combination. The IC was not positive for ‘Renal failure acute’ when basing the calculation on the full database. The IC for levetiracetam and ‘Nephritis interstitial’ was 2.43 (IC025=2.01) based on the full database. Renal failure in children After removal of 21 duplicates, 14 reports on children from five countries remained and were evaluated more in-depth. Four cases were reported with ARF, of which one also had interstitial nephritis, six with renal failure, three with creatinine increased, and one with renal impairment. Five reports referred to published case reports.4-8 Ages ranged from 6 weeks to 17 years with a median of 10.5 years. Seven reports were for females, five for males, and gender was not specified in two reports. Levetiracetam was reported as the single suspect drug in six reports. Nine cases were co-reported with other AEDs: lacosamide (n=4), valproic acid (n=3), phenobarbital (n=3), diazepam (n=3), lamotrigine (n=2), phenytoin (n=2), thiopental (n=2), topiramate (n=1), clonazepam (n=1), and clobazam (n=1). Note that one report can be reported with more than one AED. Hepatic disorders were co-reported in five reports. The daily dose was recorded in nine reports and ranged from 54 mg for a 6-week-old premature baby to 2000 mg for one of the 17-year-old cases. Three cases where levetiracetam was reported as the single suspect drug with a positive dechallenge: A 17-year-old published female case report (case 1), resulting in eight duplicate reports, had the most likely causal relationship.4 The patient had been treated with levetiracetam for 10 days when diagnosed with ARF and biopsy-confirmed interstitial nephritis. She sought health care because of vomiting, loose stools and abdominal pain for the past two days. Creatinine levels were normal before she started levetiracetam and declined after withdrawal of the drug and treatment with prednisone. The authors of this publication stated that she had no prior history of renal problems or used other medications that could have explained the event. A 12-year-old female (case 2) was admitted to hospital for ARF, metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress and confusion, which was described in a published abstract.8 A few hours after admission she became encephalopathic. Levetiracetam levels were found to be high and the probable cause of encephalopathy. Levetiracetam was stopped and replaced with valproate and patient improved after about five days. The focus in the abstract was on the encephalopathy, and it was unclear what the origin of the ARF was. A 6-week-old premature baby (case 3) was diagnosed with ARF after 16 days treatment with levetiracetam. Reaction abated when the drug was withdrawn. Prematurity could contribute to the susceptibility. Further information on the above cases is given in Table 1. In another report, where levetiracetam was the single suspect drug, a 16-year-old was described to be hospitalized for encephalopathy and chorea. The patient was placed on phenytoin, and then transitioned to valproic acid and later to levetiracetam. Serum creatinine started to increase thereafter. This report did not include any other co-reported drugs. Time to onset and dechallenge information was missing for this report. Another six cases included alternative causes for the ARF: In four cases, the influence of levetiracetam in relation to the impaired renal function could not entirely be ruled out. The cases had a reasonable time to onset (3, 5, 4, 17 days) and a positive dechallenge, but levetiracetam was co-reported with drugs known to cause renal problems. One case started and stopped aciclovir during the same dates as levetiracetam. In the second case, the creatinine values peaked when the doses were highest for the suspect drugs levetiracetam, topiramate, and thiopental, and started to decrease when topiramate was withdrawn, followed by a continuous decrease after stopping levetiracetam and thiopental some days later. The third case was a 7-week-old premature baby with a complex history, who recovered from increased creatinine levels three weeks after levetiracetam had been stopped and one week after dose reduction of meropenem, which is listed with renal disorders. The fourth case was a published case reporting a suspected interaction between methotrexate and levetiracetam and where the time to onset for levetiracetam was uncertain but most likely three days.5 In two reports, the increased creatinine and renal impairment was most probably the secondary event to DRESS syndrome (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms), which is listed in the product information for levetiracetam.1 These cases had additional co-suspected AEDs: phenytoin, lacosamide and valproic acid, also known to be reported with DRESS-syndrome. One report was unassessable because of lack of information. In three cases, levetiracetam was most likely not related to the ARF, in which two reported fatal outcome: A 9-year-old male experienced status epilepticus with metabolic acidosis and developed rhabdomyolysis and hepatorenal failure.6 A 3-year-old female where the focus was on status epilepticus and the sudden interruption of lacosamide treatment.7 Renal failure in adults A total of 90 reports for adults, or with unknown age, with levetiracetam and the WHO-ART PT ‘Renal failure acute’ have been received from 11 countries in North America, Europe, Oceania and Asia. Twelve of the 90 reports were well-documented according to vigiGrade3 (score > 0.80) and were included in the analysis. Ten cases reported ARF, one renal failure, and another renal insufficiency. Ages ranged from 21 to 73 years with a median of 45 years. Five reports were for females and seven for males. Levetiracetam was reported as the single suspect drug in five reports. Six cases were co-reported with other AEDs: lamotrigine (n=3), valproic acid (n=2), phenytoin (n=2), clonazepam (n=1), clobazam (n=1), oxcarbazepine (n=1), lacosamide (n=1); one report can be recorded with more than one AED. In eight reports, the reaction abated after drug withdrawal. Time to onset of the renal failure could be determined in ten cases specified to: the same day, 1, 1, 4, 20, 30, 90 (n=2) days, and approximately 4 and 15 months after levetiracetam start, with a median of 26.5 days. The patient with the longest time to onset had a history of chronic renal impairment, and where the primary reported concern was long QT syndrome. Three of the cases reported with an increasing creatinine value in connection to levetiracetam start, followed by a reduction to normal after withdrawal of levetiracetam: A 21-year-old male received levetiracetam 250 mg per day at the start of the month (exact time not given). On the 24th, the dose was increased to 500 mg per day and clobazam was added to the regimen. Two days thereafter, a five-fold increase in the creatinine was observed along with an abnormal creatine phosphokinase (CPK). Creatinine continued to increase during two more days reaching a 10- fold increase together with an increased CPK. Levetiracetam was discontinued (no date) and replaced with lamotrigine (clobazam was continued). Patient recovered. In a 60-year-old female; the creatinine had doubled on the fourth day of treatment with levetiracetam compared with the day of treatment start. Two days thereafter, levetiracetam was withdrawn followed by a decreasing creatinine. Patient recovered fully five days after levetiracetam withdrawal. A 73-year-old male presented at hospital with convulsions and started with levetiracetam, at which time creatinine was normal. Patient had a long-time treatment history of glicazide, losartan and aspirin. The day after levetiracetam start, the creatinine had almost doubled. Two days later the creatinine was still elevated. Renal echography was normal. An allergic nephritis was suspected. Levetiracetam, gliclazide and aspirin (unclear if also losartan) was stopped and the next day the creatinine had decreased and was normal five days thereafter. Patient started with carbamazepine and re-started losartan and gliclazide. See Table 1, for further information on these cases (4-6). In seven cases, alternative causes for the renal failure or insufficiency were reported, such as other drugs (n=2); other main events associated with the renal failure (DRESS syndrome (n=2), rhabdomyolysis and status epilepticus (n=1)), or confounding factors such as cancer (n=2). Two cases were reported with QT prolongation in connection to the renal failure. Interstitial nephritis in children and adults Forty-nine reports with levetiracetam and ‘Nephritis interstitial’ were retrieved from VigiBase. Among the reports for children, one report had already been accounted for in the review of ARF and the remaining 17 reports were likely duplicates with the published 17-year-old female.4 For the adults, or reports without a given age, 13 reports were evaluated following removal of 16 duplicate reports of another published case of a 45-year-old,9 and additionally two duplicates for other cases. Ages ranged from 20 to 76 years with a median of 51 years. Nine reports were for males and four for females. Levetiracetam was reported as the single suspect drug in six reports. Five cases were co-reported with other AEDs: valproic acid (n=5), carbamazepine (n=2), topiramate (n=1), clobazam (n=1); one report can be recorded with more than one AED. In five reports, the reaction abated after drug withdrawal. Time to onset could be assessed in five reports and ranged from 1 to 12 months. In three reports, levetiracetam was reported as the single suspect drug with a positive dechallenge. See Table 1 and cases 7-9 for more information. In two cases levetiracetam was reported as the single suspect drug with a long time to onset and lacked complete dechallenge information. A 52-year-old female was diagnosed with interstitial nephritis after five months treatment with levetiracetam 2000 mg daily. Drug was stopped 10 months after event start. Patient had not recovered at the time of report. Reported concomitant drugs were: tramadol, citalopram, simvastatin, folic acid and iron. No dates were given for these drugs. A 37-year-old male was diagnosed with interstitial nephritis and renal interstitial fibrosis after about four months of treatment with levetiracetam. It is unknown if the drug was stopped. Patient had not recovered at the time of report. Reported concomitant drugs were: valproic acid and carbamazepine. No dates were given for these drugs. In another report, levetiracetam was the single suspect drug and most likely the spontaneously reported published 69-year-old case described later in this signal.10 In three reports, levetiracetam was co-suspect with other drugs but because dates were lacking it was not possible to assess which of the drugs were more likely to have induced the event. The co-suspect drugs were valproic acid, topiramate, fluconazole. Interstitial nephritis is not labelled for any of these drugs. In three additional reports, the co-suspect drugs; melperone, oesomeprazole and carbamazepine, respectively, were more likely the drugs inducing the interstitial nephritis in these cases. The main event for a 32-year-old was DRESS syndrome that was co-reported with the interstitial nephritis. Co-suspect drugs for this patient were vancomycin and valproic acid." ;

The paediatric population and ARF was the starting point for this assessment but the signal expanded to cover reports of all ages as well as encompassing interstitial nephritis. There are more than 150 reports on levetiracetam with ARF and/or interstitial nephritis in the WHO Global database of Individual Case Safety Reports,, VigiBase®, although many of these reports turned out to be duplicates. We assessed a subset of 39 reports more in-depth and found reports supporting a possible causal relationship between levetiracetam and impaired renal function, and more specifically, interstitial nephritis. Impaired renal function or related events are not described as adverse reactions in the product information for levetiracetam.
Although these events may occur only rarely, it would be beneficial to inform clinicians that levetiracetam has the potential to impair renal function.""" ;

Patient recovered after stopping levetiracetam and changing to phenytoin. A 69-year-old woman, who after two weeks treatment with levetiracetam presented with severe mouth mucosal ulceration secondary to herpes simplex virus, and feeling unwell with wide spread rash, elevated creatinine, leukocyte count and because of worsening azotaemia she needed haemodialysis. Levetiracetam was changed to valproic acid and her renal function gradually improved.10" ;
