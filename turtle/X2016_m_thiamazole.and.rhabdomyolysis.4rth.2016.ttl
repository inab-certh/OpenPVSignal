            OpenPVSignal:has_content "In summary, there are 19 reports reporting rhabdomyolysis with the use of thiamazole and this appears to be a signal. Although there were other drugs suspected in six of the 19 reports, thiamazole appears to be the most likely explanation in two of the six reports as well as in the other 13 reports in which it was the only suspected drug. Time to onset is consistent with a drug induced effect. Dechallenge is very supportive of a drug association with probably 10 of the 12 patients who were reported as recovered or recovering on withdrawal of, or dose reduction of thiamazole. There is also a report of a positive rechallenge. Rhabdomyolysis is not mentioned in the product information for thiamazole although it does mention myalgia as a possible adverse reaction. In the product literature for carbimazole (which is converted to thiamazole in the body), it is noted that isolated cases of myopathy have been reported. In the literature, there is one report describing rhabdomyolysis in association with thiamazole. In addition, there is a literature report of three patients who developed rhabdomyolysis during treatment with carbimazole." ;

            OpenPVSignal:has_content "Case reports in VigiBaseÂ® suggest that there is a signal for the association of thiamazole and rhabdomyolysis. Thiamazole was the only drug suspected in 13 of the 19 cases. There were other drugs suspected in the remaining six cases. In Case 7, rosuvastatin is a co-suspected drug. Statins are a well-known cause of rhabdomyolysis and could be a more likely cause. Onset occurred nine days after initiation of rosuvastatin and recovery occurred after rosuvastatin withdrawal. This seems more indicative of causality than the use of thiamazole for which the reaction occurred six months after use - however, recovery also occurred after dose reduction of thiamazole. As discussed below, there is a possibility of an interaction between methimazole and rosuvastatin but rosuvastatin is less likely to be involved in CYP interactions than simvastatin.6 In Case 20, an interaction between simvastatin and thiamazole was suspected by the reporter. Thiamazole has been demonstrated to be an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and a published case report demonstrated an interaction between thiamazole and erythromycin, well known to be metabolised by CYP 3A4.7,8 Inhibition of this enzyme can result in an accumulation of erythromycin and the occurrence of toxic effects. It is possible in Case 20 that thiamazole may have inhibited the metabolism of simvastatin and resulted in an accumulation of the drug which may have made the patient more susceptible to rhabdomyolysis. Precise dates are unavailable in this report but for rhabdomyolysis to be in association with thiamazole, it had to occur within six days of starting thiamazole. On the other hand, simvastatin had been taken for 4 months and either simvastatin alone or an interaction with thiamazole seems a more likely cause. In Case 3/4, propylthiouracil was also suspected and although there are no dates available on which to ascertain the likelihood of causality, myopathy is listed as an adverse reaction in the product information for propylthiouracil and it may be a more likely cause.9 In Case 15, an unknown drug was co-suspected. However, although the nature of this drug is unknown, it was continued while thiamazole was withdrawn and the patient recovered so thiamazole appears a more likely cause. In Case 17, ketotifen was also suspected and although there are no dates available on which to ascertain the likelihood of causality, there is no reference to any muscle effects in the product information for ketotifen, and there is no reason to suspect it as a more likely cause.10 In Case 6, there were other suspected drugs including propylthiouracil, alprazolam, bisoprolol, candesartan, furosemide, lansoprazole, spironolactone and warfarin. In this case, thiamazole was replaced with propylthiouracil five weeks before onset of rhabdomyolysis and thiamazole appears an unlikely cause with propylthiouracil a much more likely cause. The role of the other seven drugs is unclear but none of them appear to be a likely cause. Time to onset was reported in 13 of the reports and ranged from two days to six months with a median of about two months. This would appear to be consistent with a thiamazole related event. The outcome of the rhabdomyolysis was stated in 14 reports and the patients were reported as recovered or recovering in 12 cases and not recovered in the remaining two cases. In the 12 cases where recovery was reported, it appears likely that the drug was withdrawn in seven cases, the dose reduced in three cases, the drug withdrawn prior to the onset of the reaction in one case and the fate of the drug was unknown in the remaining case. In one case where recovery was documented, the reaction recurred on rechallenge. The observation of recovery on withdrawal or dose reduction in 10 cases as well as the observation of recurrence on rechallenge are strongly suggestive of a drug-induced effect. In the literature, there is one report describing rhabdomyolysis in association with thiamazole.3 In addition, there is a literature report of another antithyroid drug, carbimazole (which is converted to thiamazole in the body) of three patients who developed rhabdomyolysis during treatment with carbimazole.4 It is also known that hypothyroidism can cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.11,12,13 This gives rise to the possibility that thiamazole-induced hypothyroidism may have been a cause. Only two of the reports, however, mention hypothyroidism as a reaction so this appears to be an unlikely cause. It is interesting that 16 of the 19 patients were Japanese. There is, however, no evidence in the literature that metabolism of thiamazole is different in Japanese patients and it is possible that the high proportion of Japanese patients may be related to usage." ;

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content "Thiamazole, also known as methimazole, inhibits the syntheses of thyroid hormones and thus is effective in treating hyperthyroidism. Â In the United States, Thiamazole is indicated in patients with Gravesâ disease with hyperthyroidism or toxic multinodular goitre for whom surgery or radioactive iodine therapy is not an appropriate option and to ameliorate symptoms of hyperthyroidism in preparation for thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy. More broadly, it is used for treatment of hyperthyroidism. Â Minor adverse reactions include gastrointestinal disorders, skin reactions and a variety of other reactions including myalgia. Serious adverse reactions include inhibition of myelopoieses (agranulocytosis, granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia and aplastic anaemia), drug fever, a lupus-like syndrome, insulin autoimmune syndrome, hepatitis, periarteritis, and hypoprothrombinaemiaÂ .1 Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by the leakage of muscle-cell contents, including electrolytes, myoglobin, and other sarcoplasmic proteins (e.g., creatine kinase, aldolase, lactatedehydrogenase, alanineaminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase) into the circulation. Massive necrosis, which is manifested as limb weakness, myalgia, swelling, and commonly, gross pigmenturia without haematuria, is the common denominator of both traumatic and nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury is a potential complication of severe rhabdomyolysis. Â There are a number of possible causes including trauma, exertion, muscle hypoxia, genetic defects, infections, body temperature changes, metabolic and electrolyte disorders and drugs and toxins. Drugs include lipid lowering agents such as statins and fibrates, alcohol, heroin and cocaine.2 Â " ;

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content "As of 1 September 2015 there are 20 individual case safety reports of rhabdomyolysis in association with thiamazole in VigiBaseÂ®, the WHO international database of suspected adverse drug reactions (Table 1). After the elimination of one suspected duplicate, the reports were submitted from Japan (16 reports), Germany (2) and Spain (1). The patients ranged in age from 9 to 77 years with a median of 39 years. There were 10 males and 9 females. Thiamazole was the only drug suspected in 13 of the 19 cases. In the six cases with co-suspected drugs, four cases reported propylthiouracil, rosuvastatin, ketotifen, and an unknown drug respectively as the other suspected drug and one case reported alprazolam, bisoprolol, candesartan, furosemide, lansoprazole, propylthiouracil, spironolactone and warfarin. The remaining case suspected an interaction between thiamazole and simvastatin. Concomitant drugs were reported in 12 of the 19 cases. Apart from drugs indicated for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in three cases, other drugs for the treatment of a thyroid-related condition in two cases and drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular conditions in a few cases, the concomitant drugs were used to treat a variety of conditions. Thiamazole was reported to have been administered orally, as expected, in 17 of the 18 cases which provided this information. In the remaining case, the drug was administered intravenously. The indication for use was stated in 16 reports and included Basedowâs disease in 10 reports, hyperthyroidism in three reports, thyrotoxicosis in two reports and toxic diffuse goitre in the remaining report. Dosage was reported in 15 cases and varied from 2.5 mg daily to 80 mg daily with many cases showing variation in dosage as the dose was titrated to achieve the most appropriate maintenance dosage. Time to onset was reported in 13 of the reports and ranged from two days to six months with a median of about two months. The outcome of the rhabdomyolysis was stated in 14 reports and the patients were reported as recovered or recovering in 12 cases and not recovered in the remaining two cases. In the 12 cases where recovery was reported, it is likely that the drug was withdrawn in seven cases, the dose reduced in three cases, the drug withdrawn prior to the onset of the reaction in one case and the fate of the drug was unknown in the remaining case. In some reports the dates were unclear but the interpretation above is considered to be the most likely. In one case where recovery was documented, the reaction recurred on rechallenge. Most of the reports (13) described only rhabdomyolysis as a reaction. In the six other reports other reactions were reported but only white cell disorders and hypothyroidism, which probably relates to the underlying condition, were reported twice. There was only one report in which adverse renal function was reported but this was only abnormal renal function rather than acute renal injury. Rhabdomyolysis is characterised by high levels of creatine kinase (CK). Twelve reports provided laboratory values for CK and these ranged from a maximum value of 927 IU/L to a maximum value of 66,580 IU/L (median: 4406 IU/L)." ;

Massive necrosis, which is manifested as limb weakness, myalgia, swelling, and commonly, gross pigmenturia without haematuria, is the common denominator of both traumatic and nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis. Acute kidney injury is a potential complication of severe rhabdomyolysis. There are a number of possible causes including trauma, exertion, muscle hypoxia, genetic defects, infections, body temperature changes, metabolic and electrolyte disorders and drugs and toxins. Drugs include lipid lowering agents such as statins and fibrates, alcohol, heroin and cocaine.2" ;

                OpenPVSignal:has_content """Thiamazole, also known as methimazole, inhibits the syntheses of thyroid hormones and thus is effective in treating hyperthyroidism. Thiamazole is indicated in patients with Gravesâ disease with hyperthyroidism or toxic multinodular goitre for whom surgery or radioactive iodine therapy is not an appropriate option and to ameliorate symptoms of hyperthyroidism in preparation for thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine therapy. After the elimination of a duplicate there are currently (1 September 2015) 19 individual case safety reports in VigiBaseÂ®, the WHO international database of suspected adverse drug reactions, of rhabdomyolysis in association with thiamazole. The reports are from Germany, Japan and Spain. The outcome of the rhabdomyolysis was stated in 14 reports and the patients were reported as recovered or recovering in 12 cases and not recovered in the remaining two cases. In the 12 cases where recovery was reported, it is likely that the drug was withdrawn in seven cases, the dose reduced in three cases, the drug withdrawn prior to the onset of the reaction in one case and the fate of the drug was unknown in the remaining case. In one case where recovery was documented, the reaction recurred on rechallenge. Case reports in VigiBaseÂ® suggest that there is a possible signal for the association of thiamazole and rhabdomyolysis. Thiamazole was the only suspected drug in 13 of the 19 cases and although there were other drugs suspected in six of the 19 reports, thiamazole appears to be the most likely explanation in two of the six reports as well as in the other 13 reports. Time to onset is consistent with a drug induced effect. Dechallenge is supportive of a drug association with probably 10 of the 12 patients recovered or recovering on withdrawal or dose reduction of thiamazole as well as a positive rechallenge in one case. In addition, there is a report in the literature describing rhabdomyolysis in association with thiamazole as well as a report of a closely related antithyroid drug, carbimazole, of three patients who developed rhabdomyolysis during treatment with that drug.
