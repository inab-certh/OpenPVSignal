However, the risk of panic attacks seems  not to be explicitly mentioned in patient information  leaflets, and patients may not associate their severe  experience with the listed adverse drug reactions.  Indeed, we have identified several cases where  neither the patient nor the doctor linked the panic  attacks to a levothyroxine treatment, or at least did  not attempt to alleviate the symptoms by  considering to lower levothyroxine dose. The severe  impact on quality of life in many of these cases  warrants careful consideration. Patients should be  made aware that panic attacks while on  levothyroxine could be related to the medicine, and  that those who suffer these symptoms should  consult their treating physicians about possibly  lowering their dose; further, that physicians be  reminded that panic attacks associated with  therapeutic overdoses of levothyroxine may have a  significant impact on the patient’s well-being and  daily living, to the point that patients themselves  might experiment with dose changes or treatment  termination, and be vigilant of such symptoms in  their patients.

                   OpenPVSignal:has_content """As of November 2016, there were 187 reports  of 'Panic attacks and disorders' (MedDRA high  level term) with levothyroxine in VigiBase®,  the WHO global database of individual case  safety reports. In 80% of the cases,  levothyroxine was the single suspected drug  and in just over 50% of the cases it was the  only reported drug. 90% of the reports were  for women, which correlates well with the  overall proportion of reports for women for  levothyroxine (85%), especially since there are  also more reports of panic attacks for women than for men in VigiBase®. The patients were  between 16 and 81 years old (median 51), and  80% were between 18 and 64, in line with the  overall reporting patterns for levothyroxine and for 'Panic attacks and disorders'. 112 reports were  from the United States (US), 30 from the  Netherlands, 14 from the United Kingdom (UK) and  13 from Germany. Beyond that, there were 6  reports from Canada, 4 from Italy, and 3 from  Sweden, as well as single reports from Austria,  Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and Spain. The  highest yearly rate was 41 reports in 2014; 135  reports were submitted from 2011 and onward. This  is in line with the overall reporting patterns in  VigiBase® for levothyroxine and/or panic attacks  and disorders. One noteworthy feature of the reports on  levothyroxine together with 'Panic attacks and  disorders' in VigiBase® is that 80% come directly  from patients, as compared with 56% for  levothyroxine overall and 56% for panic attacks and  disorders overall. In contrast, only 9% of the  reports come from physicians, as compared with  24% for levothyroxine overall and 23% for 'Panic  attacks and disorders' overall. Another noteworthy feature of the reports on  levothyroxine together with 'Panic attacks and  disorders' in VigiBase® is that 26% also involve  palpitations, as compared with 10% for  levothyroxine reports overall and only 8% for  reports on 'Panic attacks and disorders' overall. This  supports our hypothesis that these reported  adverse effects reflect a more severe presentation of the known adverse reactions to levothyroxine. Several reports note that the panic attacks stopped  after levothyroxine treatment was discontinued or the dose was lowered. In at least two cases, the  panic attacks recurred when the levothyroxine  treatment was re-introduced: A woman of 48 years had been on stable  levothyroxine treatment for hypothyroidism for six years when she began to suffer from confusion,  impairment of memory and impairment of  concentration, along with restlessness, paranoia  and panic reactions. By her own account, she  stopped levothyroxine, upon which the symptoms  resolved. When she restarted treatment, the  symptoms returned. A woman of 50 years initiated levothyroxine  treatment for latent hypothyroidism. Within hours,  she suffered panic attacks, tremor, and unrest. She  was more than once admitted to hospital, and she  mentioned that her social life was almost  impossible. The dose was subsequently reduced,  and finally the therapy was discontinued leading to  regression of the symptoms. At a later stage the  medication was restarted with recurrence of the  adverse effects within a week after start of  treatment. She was then switched to drops and  recovered completely. The severe impact on quality of life for many of the  affected patients, and the observation that many  remained undiagnosed as probable adverse drug  reactions for long periods of time, are illustrated by  the following examples: A woman of 28 years initiated levothyroxine  treatment and suffered gradual symptoms of  anxiety and panic attacks, to the point where  she described neglecting her job, and  eventually going on 50% sick leave. She also  lost weight from a BMI of 25 to 19. After more  than a year she herself associated the panic  attacks and anxiety with her levothyroxine  treatment and lowered the dose, after which all  reactions abated and had not since returned. A woman of 51 years suffered severe anxiety  and panic attacks, along with muscle pain,  cramps, and extreme tiredness, while on  levothyroxine. She suspected that her dose  was possibly too high, but the doctor had said  that her levels were normal. The symptoms  forced her to work part-time, reduce her  leisure activities, and seek help for depression. A woman of unknown age had been on  levothyroxine treatment for two years and  suffered trembling inside, paraesthesia and  panic reactions. She suspected that the  symptoms might be caused by levothyroxine,  and consulted several physicians on the  matter, but felt that they did not pay attention  to the symptoms. Against their  recommendation, she temporarily stopped her  levothyroxine treatment on several occasions,  but always resumed therapy. The outcome of  these dechallenge and rechallenge  interventions was not reported. Many of the 30 cases from the Netherlands are  part of a larger case series where a change in  packaging from bottles to blister packs is suspected to have led to better preservation of  the active substance, causing higher effective  doses at the same nominal strength of the  tablets. 3 This would be consistent with the  hypothesis that the panic attacks were mainly  the result of a therapeutic over-dose. However,  in several of these cases, the problems are  reported to have remained despite a lowering  of the dose, which could appear inconsistent  from a pharmacological viewpoint, but might  indicate that once developed into a clinical  problem the pattern of panic attacks may not immediately reverse with removal of the causal  agent.

                OpenPVSignal:has_content """Close to 200 reports in VigiBase®, the WHO global  database of individual case safety reports, describe  patients who have suffered panic attacks while on  levothyroxine treatment. Among these are detailed  accounts where the panic attacks have ceased upon stopping levothyroxine treatment or lowering the  dose, and sometimes recurred after repeated  exposure. The impact on patients’ well-being and  daily activities can be significant, with repeated  hospital admissions, extended sick-leave, impaired  social life and more. Some patients had been on  stable treatment for years without change in  product or dose before the problems began, which  delayed the consideration of a causal association.  Palpitations, tremor and sweating are known  adverse drug reactions to levothyroxine, so a causal  association is plausible, and may be viewed by  health professionals as expected. However, patients  may fail to associate their severe experiences with  the listed symptoms. They should be made aware  that panic attacks while on levothyroxine could be  related to the medicine, and that those who suffer  these symptoms should consult their treating  physicians about possibly lowering their dose.  Physicians should be reminded that panic attacks  associated with therapeutic overdoses of  levothyroxine may have a significant effect on the  patient’s well-being, to the point that patients  themselves might experiment with dose changes or  treatment termination. The signal was identified in  the joint UMC/Lareb signal detection sprint, in  October 2016.

Physicians should be reminded that panic attacks  associated with therapeutic overdoses of  levothyroxine may have a significant effect on the  patient’s well-being, to the point that patients  themselves might experiment with dose changes or  treatment termination. The signal was identified in  the joint UMC/Lareb signal detection sprint, in  October 2016.

Levothyroxine is a synthetic preparation of T4  L-thyroxine used for lifelong hormone replacement  therapy in patients with hypothyroidism. It is also  used for the treatment of enlarged thyroid glands  (goiter) and for the treatment of some types of thyroid cancer. The prevalence of spontaneous  hypothyroidism is between 1 and 2%, and up  to 10 times as common in women as in men. 1 Levothyroxine doses need to be carefully  titrated, and the symptoms of overdose reflect  those of hyperthyroidism. Many of these are  similar to the symptoms and signs of  adrenergic excess and include nervousness,  palpitations, hyperactivity, increased sweating,  insomnia, and more. 2 Panic attacks are brief periods with a sudden  onset of intense discomfort, anxiety or fear.  They are accompanied by somatic symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness, and palpitations;  and by cognitive symptoms such as fear of dying, fear of going crazy, and depersonalization. Up  to 10% of the population have been estimated  to suffer one or more panic attacks in a single  year. It may also work the other way around,  in which case a sudden onset of palpitations or  chest pain triggers anxiety in predisposed  patients. " ;
