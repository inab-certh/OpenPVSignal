                           OpenPVSignal:has_content "Peripheral neuropathy is a common adverse effect of several chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes, platinum agents, vinca alkaloids, thalidomide, and bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor. No single mechanism explaining the peripheral neuropathy has been identified and the precise pathophysiology remains complex.11 A number of mechanisms for drug-induced peripheral neuropathy have been postulated, including immune-based demyelination.5 In clinical trials there was at least one case of peripheral neuropathy potentially related to ruxolitinib among the 39 patients in the essential thrombocythemia cohort in an ongoing phase 2 study.12,13 Of these 37 cases on ruxolitinib suspected to cause peripheral neuropathy in VigiBase, it is not possible to draw any conclusions regarding a possible mechanism, but it should be noted that other immunomodulatory drugs such as TNFα blocking molecules may cause peripheral neuropathy via demyelination.5 For some other JAK inhibitors, peripheral neuropathy has been commonly observed. At one institution, treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy was documented in 44 of 100 myelofibrosis patients treated with the JAK1/2 inhibitor momelotinib,14 and with XL019, a selective JAK2 inhibitor, peripheral neuropathy was observed in seven out of nine patients in a phase 1 trial.15 This substance was also used in a study of 30 patients with myelofibrosis where central and/or peripheral neurotoxicity (including later onset of classical “glove and stocking” sensory peripheral neuropathy) developed in all patients, leading to termination of the study.16 In the present case series, there were two cases with obvious indications of significant confounding, namely the case where the patient experienced peripheral neuropathy while using thalidomide and the case where the patient was on chemotherapy when the peripheral neuropathy occurred. Among the other 35 reports there were medicines with known potential to cause peripheral neuropathy listed in eight reports. In none of them, however, were these drugs reported as suspected, and five of these drugs were lipid lowering agents, commonly used in this elderly population. In light of a possible class effect and a possible mechanism, these cases constitute a signal of peripheral neuropathy induced by ruxolitinib, and this merits further investigation to assess the need for updating relevant product information." ;

Most of these reports originated from the United States (28); others came from Austria (2), France (2), Ireland (1), Greece (1), Italy (1), Slovenia (1) and the United Kingdom (1). In all 37 reports ruxolitinib was reported as the sole suspect drug. In 29 of them ruxolitinib was used for the indication myelofibrosis, in three cases the indication was polycythaemia, in one case the indication was lymphatic disorder and in four the indication was unknown. Twenty of the 37 cases were reported by a physician. Among the 36 reports where information on gender was provided, 19 patients were female and 17 patients male. The median age was 72 years (range 49 to 91 years). Time to onset ranged from seven days up to three years. Information on outcome was provided in 15 reports and included five with no recovery where the action for ruxolitinib is unknown. In two cases there was no recovery after a dose reduction of ruxolitinib and in one the patient was recovering after dose reduction. The remaining cases included four negative dechallenges and three positive dechallenges. One positive dechallenge case had the restart of ruxolitinib in a lower dose, with an unknown outcome. In another positive dechallenge case, atorvastatin, which is a rare cause of peripheral neuropathy,6 was withdrawn at the same time as ruxolitinib. A review of concomitant drugs identified three cases where drugs known to be a common cause of peripheral neuropathy were reported (hydroxycarbamide in two reports and tacrolimus in one).7,8 In four cases HMG-CoAreductase inhibitors (simvastatin and atorvastatin), and in one bezafibrate, were reported as concomitant drugs. These are known to possibly cause peripheral neuropathy in rare cases.9,10 Reviewing the medical history identified two cases where the patient had previously used drugs known to cause peripheral neuropathy, namely hydroxycarbamide in one report and thalidomide in the other. In the second case, it its known that the patient experienced peripheral neuropathy while using thalidomide but information is lacking on action taken with thalidomide and outcome of neuropathy. Another case mentions that the patient was on chemotherapy (bortezomib) when the peripheral neuropathy occurred and that ruxolitinib was used before and after the chemotherapy." ;

                        OpenPVSignal:has_content "Background This document provides Novartis’ comment on the draft of “Ruxolitinib and peripheral neuropathy” which concluded that a causal association between ruxolitinib and peripheral neuropathy may exist and which will be published in Signal from UMC – WHO Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring. Peripheral neuropathy was fully evaluated as a potential signal in the Jakavi® (ruxolitinib) PSUR 5 (23 Aug 2014 – 22 Feb 2015) based on a literature report1 describing treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy (TE-PN) with momelotinib (a JAK-1/2 inhibitor that also targets TYK22 ). As a result of evaluating peripheral neuropathy and discussing it with health authorities, it was ultimately concluded that at this time, peripheral neuropathy does not constitute an important potential risk and should be continued to be monitored as part of routine pharmacovigilance activities for ruxolitinib. The evaluation of ruxolitinib does not support the hypothesis that peripheral neuropathy is class-related, as the kinase selectivity and pharmacological profile of other JAK inhibitors differs from that of ruxolitinib, e.g. due to inhibition of non-JAK family kinases. For instance, momelotinib, originally described as a selective JAK1/2 inhibitor, is also a potent TBK1/IKKε inhibitor (IC50=58 nM and 42 nM, respectively).3 In contrast, ruxolitinib fails to inhibit TBK1 or IKKε in this assay (IC50 >1 μM for both). Two other JAK inhibitors were associated with neurotoxicity which resulted in termination of further clinical development. The first one, XL019, a highly selective JAK2 inhibitor was associated with central and/or peripheral neurotoxicity in all patients. Since neurotoxicity, particularly CNS neurotoxicity has been rare or absent in studies of other JAK2 inhibitors and its almost universal occurrence with XL019, suggests likely an undefined, off target effect.4 Another potent selective JAK 1/2 inhibitor, AZD 1480, was associated with low grade neurotoxicity that was considered unacceptable in long term therapy.5 In addition, there was a single literature report of a distal symmetric polyneuropathy in a patient treated with tofacitinib (Xeljanz®), a JAK1/3 inhibitor for rheumatoid arthritis.6 Epidemiology Neurological manifestations including peripheral neuropathy have been reported with myeloproliferative neoplasms. Peripheral neuropathy in patients with polycythemia vera was explained with the underlying mechanism of hypoxia due to increased blood viscosity and abnormal platelet aggregation associated with the disease.7,8,9 In a report from Kawasaki Y et al.10 neurological disturbance of the lower extremities was seen in a patient due to extramedullary hematopoietic mass complicated with primary myelofibrosis. In a study that reviewed 28 patients with a PV diagnosis, 11 experienced paresthesia. In 13 (46%) patients, clinical examination revealed features suggesting polyneuropathy. Nerve conduction indexes were abnormal in 20 (71%) patients, suggesting the presence of a predominantly sensory axonal polyneuropathy. No literature reports of peripheral neuropathy linked to ruxolitinib were retrieved. Data from interventional trials There were no clear differences in the incidence rates of peripheral neuropathy (narrow SMQ) observed in the randomized periods in the two phase III studies in myelofibrosis (Study CINCB18424-351 and Study CINC424A2352) and polycythemia vera (CINC424B2301 and CINC424B2401). In MF, the incidence was 3% in ruxolitinib arm vs 2.2% in control arms. In PV, in the incidence was 2.7% in ruxolitinib arm vs. 3.2% in control arm. In longer term follow-up in both MF and PV, exposure-adjusted analysis showed no disproportionate increase in frequency with prolonged exposure. Data from the safety database Novartis global safety database was searched cumulatively through 22 Feb 2017, with the following PTs: Neuropathy peripheral/Polyneuropathy/Peripheral motor neuropathy/Peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy/Peripheral sensory neuropathy/Axonal neuropathy and retrieved 103 cases (with 107 events). Of these, in 42 cases, the event was confounded by medical conditions (such as pre-existing neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorder) and concomitant medications (such as statins, thalidomide and its anologues) which are either associated with or can lead to neuropathy. In five cases, due to implausible temporal relationship or negative rechallenge, the role of ruxolitinib in relation to the events was unlikely. In 55 cases, limited information precluded complete medical assessment. In the remaining case, due to positive dechallenge and absence of strong explanation, the role of ruxolitinib in polyneuropathy was considered possible. Disproportionality analysis Traditional safety signal detection activities for all marketed products (both, multinational and mono-national) are supported by a data mining tool, the Empirica Signal System™ (ESS) applied to the Novartis safety database. The disproportionality analyses use the MGPS (Multi-Item Gamma Poisson Shrinker) statistical algorithm and statistical hits are considered when the lower limit of the confidence interval (EB05) is greater than 2. Quantitative analysis using Novartis safety database in the Empirica signal system was performed for peripheral neuropathy and did not reveal a technical signal (defined as EB05>2), with a maximal EB05 of 1.487 through March 2017. Conclusions At this time, it is not possible for the sponsor to conclude that peripheral neuropathy is caused by JAK inhibition based on the currently available clinical trial and postmarketing safety data coupled with the known mechanistic data of ruxolitinib. However, the MAH agrees with UMC and will continue monitoring peripheral neuropathy by applying routine pharmacovigilance as well as data mining technologies. The safety topic will be presented again, should future data indicate causality. References 1. Abdelrahman RA, Begna KH, Al-Kali A, Hogan WJ, Litzow MR, Pardanani A, et al (2015).

              OpenPVSignal:has_content "Ruxolitinib (INCB018424) is a selective inhibitor of the Janus Associated Kinases (JAKs) 1 and 2. These mediate the signalling of a number of cytokines and growth factors that are important for haematopoiesis and immune function.1 Ruxolitinib has significant clinical benefits in patients with myelofibrosis by reducing spleen size, ameliorating debilitating myelofibrosisrelated symptoms, and improving overall survival.2 Ruxolitinib has also been demonstrated to be superior to standard therapy in controlling the hematocrit, reducing the spleen volume, and improving symptoms associated with polycythemia vera.3 In the United States, ruxolitinib is at present approved for treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, including primary myelofibrosis, post- polycythemia vera myelofibrosis and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis, as well as in patients with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to, or are intolerant of, hydroxyurea.4 In Europe also, ruxolitinib is authorized for myelofibrosis and polycythaemia vera, specifically for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary myelofibrosis (also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis or post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis, as well as for the treatment of adult patients with polycythaemia vera who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea.1 The most commonly reported adverse reactions in clinical trials were haematological, and the most frequent non-haematological reactions were bruising, dizziness, headache, constipation and herpes zoster. Serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal and viral infections, including progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, have occurred during treatment with ruxolitinib, and physicians are advised to carefully observe patients receiving ruxolitinib for signs and symptoms of infections, and to initiate appropriate treatment promptly.1,4 Peripheral neuropathy may be caused by a number of drugs and is one of the main reasons for patients to prematurely terminate antineoplastic treatment. Drug- induced peripheral neuropathies are often characterized by the development of a subacute or chronic, symmetrical polyneuropathy with a predominant sensory involvement.5 Molecular mechanisms of drug-induced peripheral neuropathies have been addressed in several studies and a number of mechanisms have been postulated, including cytotoxic inflammatory changes, mitochondrial toxicity and enhanced oxidative stress, microtubular function disruption, voltage-gated ion channel dysfunction, functional impairment of ion channels of the transient receptor potential family, induction of neuronal apoptosis in dorsal root ganglia, demyelination, and reduction of VEGF neuro-protective action.5 During a UMC signal detection screening in March 2016 which focused on recently approved drugs and adverse events reported with a serious outcome, the safety issue concerning axonal neuropathy in relation to ruxolitinib was observed. For this review the scope was widened to peripheral neuropathy." ;

During a UMC signal detection screening in March 2016 the safety issue concerning axonal neuropathy in relation to ruxolitinib was noted. Literature shows that in patients treated with other JAK inhibitors peripheral neuropathy has been observed. In this review of 37 cases of ruxolitinib associated axonal and peripheral neuropathy reported to VigiBase, the WHO global database of individual case safety reports, we concluded that a causal association between ruxolitinib and peripheral neuropathy may exist, and represents a signal worth communicating so that stakeholders may act upon it." ;
