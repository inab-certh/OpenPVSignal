Given that the action of these agents is independent of both insulin secretion and insulin action, another benefit of these agents is a lower risk of hypoglycaemia." ;

This safety concern is common enough that it was observed in clinical trials and has been fairly well characterised. Genital infections are largely fungal in nature, manifesting as mycotic vulvovaginitis in females and mycotic balanitis in males. Such infections have been estimated to affect 5-10% of patients using SGLT-2i and are more common in premenopausal women, patients with a history of genital infections, and obese patients. There was no evidence of a relationship between the incidence of genital infections and the amount of glycosuria observed in the clinical trials. Furthermore, rates of infections are highest in the first few months of treatment.2-4" ;

Forty-eight reports of pruritus genital (48.5%) have been received for dapagliflozin, 31 (31.3%) for canagliflozin and 20 (20.2%) for empagliflozin. 67.7% of the reports have been described events in females, 28.3% of the reports for males. 40.4% of the reports originated from the Americas, 36.4% from Europe, and 23.2% from Asia. The most commonly co-reported MedDRA PT were genital burning sensation (9.1%), pollakiuria (7.1%) and dysuria (5.1%). Twenty-three of the reports were received from consumers or non-health professionals (eight of which were classified as “serious”) and 25 were received from physicians (none of which were classified as “serious”). Furthermore, fifty-four (54.5%) of the reports documented that the drug was discontinued secondary to the reported adverse drug reactions." ;

              OpenPVSignal:has_content "Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) are members of a relatively new class of oral antidiabetic agents. Three medicines in this class, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and empagliflozin, are currently marketed for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus as monotherapy or in combination with other agents.  SLGT-2i work by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the kidney and thereby promoting urinary excretion of glucose. Studies have revealed that SGLT-2i have beneficial effects on blood glucose levels, but also they reduce blood pressure and induce weight loss. Given that the action of these agents is independent of both insulin secretion and insulin action, another benefit of these agents is a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. 1 Given their mechanism of action, one of the major safety concerns for the SLGT-2i is an increased risk of genital infections caused by high levels of glucose in the urine. This safety concern is common enough that it was observed in clinical trials and has been fairly well characterised.  Genital infections are largely fungal in nature, manifesting as mycotic vulvovaginitis in females and mycotic balanitis in males. Such infections have been estimated to affect 5-10% of patients using SGLT-2i and are more common in premenopausal women, patients with a history of genital infections, and obese patients . There was no evidence of a relationship between the incidence of genital infections and the amount of glycosuria observed in the clinical trials. Furthermore, rates of infections are highest in the first few months of treatment.2-4" ;

Itching in the genital area is a common non-serious adverse reaction for these types of drugs which was known at the time of approval. A joint UMC/Lareb signal detection sprint performed in October 2016, highlighted reports from patients that were retrieved from VigiBase, the WHO global database of individual case safety reports, which revealed that often patients stop taking these medications because of this adverse event. A 71 year old female with a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension was initiated on empagliflozin. The patient was treated for cystitis approximately one month after starting therapy. Also, the patient experienced non-serious events of thrush, burning in the urogenital area, redness in the urogenital area, blistering in the urogenital area and hypoglycaemia. In the course of five days the itching increased up to intolerability. Therapy for the event of cystitis was antibiotics and antifungal cream; therapy of the symptoms in the urogenital area included unspecified ointments without success and a mild-cortisone containing ointment which helped slightly. Empagliflozin was discontinued. A 60 year old female experienced severe itching, soreness, and reddening of the genital area and an inability to sit while on therapy with dapagliflozin. The patient was diagnosed with candidal mycosis and treated with antifungal cream. The cream did not bring improvement and the patient discontinued dapagliflozin “on her own” in response to the events." ;
