            <http://purl.org/OpenPVSignal/OpenPVSignal.owl#has_content> "The concomitant use of thymidine nucleoside analogues and 5-FU products is known to cause fatal 5-FU toxicity. In the early 1990s, sorivudine, another nucleoside thymidine analogue, was reported to have caused 18 deaths in Japan when used in conjunction with 5-FU; consequently, sorivudine was removed from the market.6 The mechanism of action for this fatal drug interaction is the same for brivudine; bromovinyl uracil, the major metabolite of both drugs, irreversibly binds to and inhibits dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). DPD is an enzyme in the hepatic system responsible for the inactivation of 5-FU.4 In animal studies, this inhibition of DPD by co-administration of sorivudine, has led to a 5.5-fold increase in plasma 5-FU area under the curve (AUC) on the first day and up to eight times increase by day 6, when compared to the administration of 5-FU alone.6 An important additional fact is that DPD is responsible for about 85% of 5-FU metabolism. Its activity is immediately and almost completely suppressed, with the introduction of BVU, and toxicity-averting DPD activity did not return until at least 14 days after the cessation of SRV.  A fourweek period between the use of 5-FU and brivudine or other BVU producing substances should be enough to avoid 5-FU toxicity.7 In spite of the fact that this drug-drug interaction is well understood and there are warnings on both products, fatalities secondary to the interaction continue to occur. Concerns regarding continuing fatalities have been raised in both Germany and Spain. In Germany, an independent medical journal, Arznei-Telegramm, published a similar analysis of cases involving the brivudine-5FU interaction and recommended that withdrawal of brivudine is the only reliable way to prevent more fatal cases.20 In a recent issue of the WHO Pharmaceuticals Newsletter, the concerns of the Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios (AEMPS) in Spain about the continued fatal cases, were reported, alongside reiterated warnings to healthcare professionals.21 Review of our case series revealed some features which could be considered as potential reasons for the persistence of fatalities. In cases 1, 3 and 4, the interacting drugs were not administered concomitantly; however, the time intervals between receipt of each drug were limited to only a few days. The patients in these cases appear to have adhered to the red warning section of the patient leaflet: they did not take brivudine while receiving 5-FU. However, the patients did not follow the non-highlighted, somewhat hidden warning “Do not take Menavir and contact your doctor immediately if you will be receiving therapy with any of the above medicines within four weeks of the end of treatment with Menavir ”. Reasons for failure to heed such a warning may be that, 1) patients limit their focus to the boxed, red section of the package leaflet which does not contain this information, and 2) patients may simply not be aware if they will be receiving chemotherapy within four weeks of stopping brivudine. In cases 2 and 3 scenarios were described in which multiple treating WHO Pharmaceuticals Newsletter No. 6, 2018 • 23 Signal physicians were involved; it appears that the health care providers recommending brivudine were not the oncologists overseeing the chemotherapy care of the patients. Prescribing information for brivudine was found inconsistently upon review of websites in a number of countries in which it is approved (Switzerland, Germany, France and Spain). 10-16 In contrast, information for health care professionals regarding the interaction was easily found within the labelling for the oncology products on the eMC website.17-19 Of particular importance is that, within the last few years, there has been approval of an antidote for fluorouracil and capecitabine toxicity.22 Uridine triacetate was approved by the US FDA in December 2015 as an emergency treatment for unintended overdose of 5-FU or capecitabine . Uridine triacetate is an acetylated form of uridine; following oral administration, it is deacetylated, and uridine competitively inhibits cell damage and death by fluorouracil. In a study of 135 patients at elevated risk for 5-FU toxicity, 96% were alive and fully recovered at 30 days.23 In the United States, under a named patient programme, VISTOGARD is provided to patients at risk of excess 5-FU toxicity due to overdose and to patients exhibiting severe toxicities to 5-FU within 96 hours of 5-FU administration.24" ;

               <http://purl.org/OpenPVSignal/OpenPVSignal.owl#has_content> "Herpes  zoster (shingles) is a viral disease often presenting as painful rashes primarily affecting the elderly population. It is caused by the reactivation of latent Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) usually decades after a primary varicella infection. Shingles is the result of reactivated VZV spreading into the corresponding dermatome and neural tissue, forming a unilateral maculopapular rash, with or without vesicles or lesions . The acute neuritis produced by herpes zoster is painful and associated with symptoms such as unusual aching, burning or stabbing pain, itching or tingling. Painful symptoms can be experienced anywhere during the spread of VZV, from before the appearance of a rash to well after vesicular eruption and healing. Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a syndrome of chronic pain persisting after the resolution of a shingles rash. This chronic pain is debilitating; it can affect quality of life and lead to psychological distress. Elderly patients with advanced cancer and on immunotherapy are at significantly higher risk of shingles . Herpes zoster is generally a self-limited disease. However, systemic antiviral therapy is indicated in patients aged 50 and above, for/with immunodeficiency, malignant primary disease, and in patients with involvement of cranial nerves; prevention and/or reduction of PHN is the focus of therapeutic intervention .1,2" ;

Its activity is immediately and almost completely suppressed, with the introduction of BVU, and toxicity-averting DPD activity did not return until at least 14 days after the cessation of SRV. A four-week period between the use of 5-FU and brivudine

                     <http://purl.org/OpenPVSignal/OpenPVSignal.owl#has_content> "The medication error focused screening of VigiBase highlighted a series of 30 reports from Germany (15), Spain (11), Italy (2), Austria (1), and Switzerland (1) reporting brivudine with MedDRA terms within the SMQ Medication Errors . Of particular interest were 22 reports in which a drug-drug interaction was described between brivudine and 5-FU (8 reports) or its prodrug, capecitabine (14 reports); 15 of which resulted in death. Cases of this interaction were first received into VigiBase in 2008 (4 reports, 3 of which were fatal); the most recent was in 2017 (4 reports, 3 fatal).  A number of example cases illustrate how the medication error by using brivudine and 5-FU together can occur: Case 1: An elderly patient was given a 6-day treatment of brivudine for shingles. Three days later, brivudine treatment was ended, and the patient was administered a 5-FU bolus to manage his colon cancer. Five days later the patient was hospitalised for severe mucositis and developed severe bone marrow aplasia. He died soon after on an unspecified date. Case 2: A patient on long-term capecitabine (Xeloda) treatment for breast cancer who developed herpes zoster while on vacation abroad. The local treating physician prescribed brivudine and the patient took both medications together. After returning to her home country she presented to the hospital feeling generally unwell. She was hospitalized and eventually developed massive mucositis with ulcers in the mouth and throat region. The report does not state the outcome. Case 3: A patient was prescribed three cycles of 5- FU treatment following surgery for colon cancer. After the second cycle the patient developed shingles and the treating dermatologist prescribed brivudine (Nervinex). Three days after completing the 7-day course of brivudine, the final cycle of 5- FU was administered; two days later the patient presented feeling very tired and generally unwell. The patient was hospitalised, blood tests showed severe pancytopenia, and 10 days later the patient died. Case 4: A patient was prescribed brivudine (Zostex) only during pauses in her treatment of capecitabine (Xeloda), which she kept at home and would use often because of frequent herpes simplex infections from massive herpes labialis. The patient started treatment with capecitabine in March and the treatment cycle ended on 22 March. During a treatment pause of seven days, the patient started treatment with brivudine, onWHO Pharmaceuticals Newsletter No. 6, 2018 • 21 Signal 27 March. On 28 March, brivudine was discontinued, and the patient started the next treatment cycle with capecitabine two days later. On 1 April, the patient started treatment with brivudine. On 2 April, she stopped the treatment with brivudine, after an intake of two tablets. On 5 April, capecitabine was withdrawn, the patient was hospitalised and eventually died due to bone marrow depression." ;

              <http://purl.org/OpenPVSignal/OpenPVSignal.owl#has_content> "Herpes zoster (shingles) is a viral disease often presenting as painful rashes primarily affecting the elderly population. It is caused by the reactivation of latent Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) usually decades after a primary varicella infection. Shingles is the result of reactivated VZV spreading into the corresponding dermatome and neural tissue, forming a unilateral maculopapular rash, with or without vesicles or lesions . The acute neuritis produced by herpes zoster is painful and associated with symptoms such as unusual aching, burning or stabbing pain, itching or tingling. Painful symptoms can be experienced anywhere during the spread of VZV, from before the appearance of a rash to well after vesicular eruption and healing. Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a syndrome of chronic pain persisting after the resolution of a shingles rash. This chronic pain is debilitating; it can affect quality of life and lead to psychological distress. Elderly patients with advanced cancer and on immunotherapy are at significantly higher risk of shingles . Herpes zoster is generally a self-limited disease. However, systemic antiviral therapy is indicated in patients aged 50 and above, for/with immunodeficiency, malignant primary disease, and in patients with involvement of cranial nerves; prevention and/or reduction of PHN is the focus of therapeutic intervention .1,2 Brivudine is a nucleoside analogue used in the treatment of herpes zoster, for which it is approved in a number of EU countries. Brivudine owes its effect to preferential phosphorylation by VZV encoded tyrosine kinase (TK) to its 5'-diphosphate form. After further conversion to triphosphate form, it acts as an inhibitor or alternate substrate for the viral DNA polymerase. It has a terminal half-life of 16 hours, and is degraded to its base form, bromovinyl uracil (BVU), by thymidine phosphorylase .3 Brivudine is also characterized by a well described fatal drug interaction with a commonly prescribed antitumour drug, 5- fluorouracil (5-FU). This drug interaction and possible mechanisms of action have been described well for many years in medical literature.4-9 In a recent screening of VigiBase, the WHO global database of ICSRs focusing on medication errors, brivudine was highlighted with the MedDRA preferred term “drug-drug interaction medication error”. An alarming number of cases had fatal outcomes and the most recent case was from 2017.  The purpose of this communication is to highlight the continued appearance of fatal cases due to medication error with use of brivudine and 5-FU." ;
