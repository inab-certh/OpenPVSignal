                      OpenPVSignal:has_content """Levonorgestrel is a second-generation progestin drug. It is widely used for contraception. For pregnancy prevention, levonorgestrel may be used alone or as combined oral contraceptives pills with oestrogen. Levonorgestrel single medicinal ingredient products include: emergency birth control pills; intrauterine devices and birth control implants. In this review, we focus on Levonorgestrel (LNG)-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) products.
LNG-IUSs are polyethylene T-shaped devices that contain LNG. After insertion of the device into the uterus, a low-dose of levonorgestrel is released at a relatively constant rate, which reduces systemic effects.
LNG-IUSs can provide contraception for three or five years, depending on the device. LNG-IUSs are considered long acting reversible contraception (LARC) and are listed among the most effective contraceptive methods because they do not depend on compliance from the user. In addition to their high efficacy, LNG- IUSs are commonly used because of their safety, ease of use, and cost effectiveness.1,2,3 The LNG-IUS products are available in multiple formulations (52 mg, 19.5 mg and 13.5 mg LNG).
Both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive use list LNG-IUS products as category 1 or 2 for postpartum breastfeeding women, which means there are no restrictions (category 1) or that the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risks (category 2).1,4
Given that a high progesterone level during pregnancy prevents prolactin (PRL) release and onset of lactation, there is a theoretical concern that LNG-IUS used for postpartum contraception may cause an increase in the progesterone level sufficient to inhibit PRL release and therefore suppress/decrease lactation. Investigations have shown that due to individual variations, some women using LNG-IUS may have a systemic hormone distribution which could explain minor hormonal systemic side effects such as acne, hirsutism, headache and mood changes.5 Although this mechanism could be the most plausible explanation of an eventual systemic effect on PRL inhibition, it has been demonstrated that the LNG- IUS effect is mainly local and plasma LNG concentration from LNG-IUS are lower than with other contraceptive methods i.e. implants, progestin only pills and combined oral contraceptives.5,6 Therefore, the biological mechanism by which LNG-IUS may cause suppressed lactation remains uncertain.""" ;

Health Canada’s safety review took into consideration scientific and medical literature, Canadian and international adverse reaction reports, as well as known information about the use of LNG-IUS products in Canada and internationally. During the assessment, Health Canada reviewed 24 published studies about women who were breastfeeding and using LNG-IUS products (scientific literature search from 1974 to February 2017). These studies concluded that the use of LNG-IUS provides highly effective birth control and that these products do not affect breastfeeding.7 An additional search covering the period from 2017 to 2018 in Embase, Medline, CAB Abstracts, Global Health and IPA did not provide any evidence suggesting that LNG-IUS products decreased breast milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This shorter period was chosen since this search for the period from 1974 to Feb 2017 had already been performed by Health Canada previously.
Health Canada’s review concluded there is limited evidence to suggest a link between levonorgestrel intrauterine devices and the risk of decreased breast milk production due to a lack of published literature and a biological mechanism that is not clear. However, there are Canadian reports of suppressed lactation in breastfeeding women using LNG-IUS with a probable/ possible causality.7 As a result of the national assessment, Health Canada updated the product information of LNG-IUS products and the current Canadian labelling states that isolated post-marketing cases of decreased milk production have been reported in women using a LNG-IUS.8,9,10
The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) labelling11,12,13 for LNG-IUS products states that isolated cases of decreased milk production have been reported with a LNG-releasing IUS. However, post- marketing cases of decreased or suppressed lactation with the use of LNG-IUS is not labelled in other parts of the world.14-17 The labelling of these products reads “A levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system does not affect the quantity or quality of breast milk”.16""" ;

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content "Given that a high progesterone level during pregnancy prevents prolactin (PRL) release and onset of lactation, there is a theoretical concern that LNG-IUS used for postpartum contraception may cause an increase in the progesterone level sufficient to inhibit PRL release and therefore suppress/decrease lactation. Investigations have shown that due to individual variations, some women using LNG-IUS may have a systemic hormone distribution which could explain minor hormonal systemic side effects such as acne, hirsutism, headache and mood changes.5 Although this mechanism could be the most plausible explanation of an eventual systemic effect on PRL inhibition, it has been demonstrated that the LNG- IUS effect is mainly local and plasma LNG concentration from LNG-IUS are lower than with other contraceptive methods i.e. implants, progestin only pills and combined oral contraceptives.5,6 Therefore, the biological mechanism by which LNG-IUS may cause suppressed lactation remains uncertain." ;

The rational for their exclusion was that routes of administration did not meet the criteria of IUS such as per oral, transmammary (parent- child cases), as well as subcutaneous, generating the remaining 181 reports with the MedDRA PT “Suppressed lactation” reported for LNG-IUS products. These reports originated from Australia, Europe, North and South America and concerned women between the ages of 16 to 44 (age unknown in 58 cases). With respect to the source of information, health care professional, consumer, and lawyer was noted as
respectively 61 cases, 93 and one. The reporter was unknown in 26 cases.
In 152 of these 181 reports, LNG-IUS is the single reported drug. In the remaining 29 reports where patients used LNG-IUS with concomitant medications, levonorgestrel was the only suspected drug in 28 reports. Most of the concomitant medications reported are prenatal/multivitamins, iron, calcium, pain killers such as naproxen or ibuprofen, natural health products such as chlorophyll, fish oil etc. Three reports had drugs used to stimulate milk production (galactagogues) such as domperidone (one case) or fenugreek. Two cases had combined oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol/ norethisterone and ethinylestradiol/norgestimate) reported as concomitant with the IUS. One report included lamotrigine. For 94 of these 181 reports, suppressed lactation was the only reaction reported. The time-to-onset varied from 0 days to 2 months and was not specified in 141 cases. 73 reports were reported as serious according to ICH seriousness criteria.
Several physiological factors can cause decreased/suppressed lactation (stress, infrequent breastfeeding, introduction of formula, etc.).
Information regarding possible maternal or neonatal factors is not available in the reports. Information on objective evidence suggesting decreased lactation (such as infant weight, stool/urine outputs, amount of breast milk expressed before and after insertion of the IUS etc.) is missing in most of these reports.
Positive dechallenge (Drug withdrawn/Reaction abated) was reported for 17 cases, of which seven were identified from narratives in Canadian reports. The following three cases describe an established lactation prior to the insertion of the IUS and the reporter provided objective evidence which may imply decreased lactation (e.g. effect on infant weight or decrease in breast milk expressed). From the reported medical history and concomitant medicines, the reported event “suppressed lactation” is unlikely to be attributable to disease or other concomitant drugs. In addition, there was a positive dechallenge (only treatment was removal of the IUS and milk supply returned back to normal) and recovery outcome implies sustained resumption of effective lactation and breastfeeding after IUS removed.
Case 1: A physician described the patient experience with LNG-releasing intrauterine device (IUD) as “Mother has Mirena IUD inserted. Baby did not gain weight. The change from a baby who was previously gaining weight very well                             was chronologically related to the IUD. Removal of IUD”                                                   getting 60-80 ml per breast. Her supply gradually decreased to 20-30 per breast and the letdown would take 8-10 minutes. IUD removed and supply was back within 1 week, Also the letdown now very fast”.
Case 3: A family physician detailed patient experiences while on LNG as follows “Patient had Mirena IUD for contraception at the time of breast feeding. Milk supply dropped within 7-10 days.
IUD was removed and ten days after removed, her milk supply returned back to normal.”

Case 2: Similarly, another Lactation doctor reported the following regarding the patient “Patient had Mirena inserted about 6 months postpartum and was pumping her breast. At the time of insertion she was pumping 4-5xday and getting 60-80 ml per breast. Her supply gradually decreased to 20-30 per breast and the letdown would take 8-10 minutes. IUD removed and supply was back within 1 week, Also the letdown now very fast”. 

Case 3: A family physician detailed patient experiences while on LNG as follows “Patient had Mirena IUD for contraception at the time of breast feeding. Milk supply dropped within 7-10 days. IUD was removed and ten days after removed, her milk supply returned back to normal.”""" ;

Health Canada’s safety review took into consideration scientific and medical literature, Canadian and international adverse reaction reports, as well as known information about the use of LNG-IUS products in Canada and internationally. During the assessment, Health Canada reviewed 24 published studies about women who were breastfeeding and using LNG-IUS products (scientific literature search from 1974 to February 2017). These studies concluded that the use of LNG-IUS provides highly effective birth control and that these products do not affect breastfeeding.7 An additional search covering the period from 2017 to 2018 in Embase, Medline, CAB Abstracts, Global Health and IPA did not provide any evidence suggesting that LNG-IUS products decreased breast milk production in breastfeeding mothers. This shorter period was chosen since this search for the period from 1974 to Feb 2017 had already been performed by Health Canada previously.
Health Canada’s review concluded there is limited evidence to suggest a link between levonorgestrel intrauterine devices and the risk of decreased breast milk production due to a lack of published literature and a biological mechanism that is not clear. However, there are Canadian reports of suppressed lactation in breastfeeding women using LNG-IUS with a probable/ possible causality.7 As a result of the national assessment, Health Canada updated the product information of LNG-IUS products and the current Canadian labelling states that isolated post-marketing cases of decreased milk production have been reported in women using a LNG-IUS.8,9,10""" ;

A total of 181 case reports of suppressed lactation in women using Levonorgestrel (LNG)- releasing intrauterine systems (IUS) were identified to require further in- depth review. In 152 cases of these 181 reports, LNG-IUS is the single reported drug product. The reports originated from Australia, Europe, North and South America. Of the 181 reports, 51% were reported by consumers. Positive dechallenge was reported for 17 cases, of which this review will highlight three well documented key cases providing objective evidence of suppressed lactation using LNG- IUS products.
There are currently no literature references suggesting that LNG-IUS products decrease breast milk production in breastfeeding mothers. However, isolated cases of suppressed lactation with the use of LNG-IUS are labelled in the USA and Canada based on post-marketing experience. These reports suggest that health care professionals and patients worldwide may benefit from increased awareness of the occurrence of isolated post- marketing reports of decreased milk production among women using LNG-IUS products.""" ;
