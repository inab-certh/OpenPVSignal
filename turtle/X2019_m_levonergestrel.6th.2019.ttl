At first, they are cyclical, peaking in the luteal phase of my cycle, but as the intensity increases, they affect me more of the time. From 6-7 months after having the coil inserted, they are very debilitating and affect my ability to work, socialise, and conduct relationships. From 9 months onwards, it becomes unbearable. I have used the Mirena coil [LNG-IUD] 4 times (each time for endometriosis) and have experienced the same pattern each time. Each time, I need to have it reinserted after a break, to control my endometriosis. Other interventions didn't work." ;

                           OpenPVSignal:has_content """Panic attack is not listed as an ADR in the EU and US patient information leaflet for LNG-IUD while some other psychiatric events are, such as depressed mood, depression, and nervousness.1,2 Even though LNG-IUD has mainly local progestogenic effects in the uterine cavity, this suggests that the substance might cross the blood- brain barrier in small concentrations and hence potentially be able to cause panic attacks. As of November 2018, there were 602 reports in VigiBase from patients and doctors of a suspected causal link between panic attacks and LNG-IUD use. In 98% of these reports LNG-IUD was the only suspect drug and in 51% the reaction subsided when the IUD was removed. Predisposing factors such as depression or a history of panic attacks was present in some cases.
In the literature, no cases of LNG-IUD and panic attacks have been published, but there are two documented cases where an LNG sub-dermal implant system is associated with depression and panic disorders. Furthermore, a signal on desogestrel, another hormonal contraceptive progestin, has been associated with panic attacks and other psychiatric disorders. This suggests that a relationship between LNG-IUDs and panic attacks might be expected. The PRAC has also discussed this combination, but the decision was not to include the ADR in the SmPC at this stage, instead recommending continued monitoring of the combinations. The cases discussed in our assessment originated from 22 countries, including within the EU, the Americas and Australia, and therefore give a broader perspective of the problem. The reporter in many cases relates a significant impact on quality of life, which many women have had during LNG-IUD use. In one case the patient expressed the stressful situation she experienced as there was nothing in the label or introduction video she saw before choosing to insert the device. In many cases the patients improved upon removal of the LNG-IUD and two cases mentioned recurrence after the second or fourth insertion.
While clinical pre- and post-marketing studies have not been able to firmly establish a causal relation between LNG-IUDs and panic attacks this does not exclude the possibility that individual women in rare cases may be more sensitive or predisposed to the reaction. We believe that the collected information in these spontaneous reports support a relationship between LNG-IUDs and panic attacks and that patients and prescribers may need to be made aware of the association.""" ;

It can be used as a single substance or as the progestogen component in oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy.1,2 Levonorgestrel as single substance is the active ingredient in emergency birth control pills, intrauterine devices, and birth control implants.
This assessment focusses on the reports in VigiBase, the WHO global database of individual case safety reports (ICSRs), for levonorgestrel (LNG)-releasing intrauterine devices (IUD), hereafter referred to as LNG-IUD. LNG-IUD are used by fertile women to prevent pregnancy, to reduce bleeding in idiopathic menorrhagia, and in combination with oestrogens for hormonal replacement therapy.1, 2
LNG-IUDs emit a low and constant hormonal dose released directly into the uterus and its endometrium. LNG-IUDs are marketed around the world and available in several strengths (52 mg,
19.5 mg and 13.5 mg levonorgestrel).1, 2
The contraceptive effect of LNG-IUDs is achieved through changes in cervical mucus inhibiting the passage of sperm, suppressed proliferation of the endometrium, and, in some women, suppression of ovulation.1-3 According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), a panic attack is a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, often accompanied by physical symptoms such as palpitations and trembling.
Experiencing repeated, consistent panic attacks that hinder everyday activity is defined as a symptom of panic disorder.4
Panic attacks may occur in a variety of somatic and psychiatric illnesses, particularly depression, but also in individuals without other morbidity. Panic disorder may present significant obstacles in every- day life.5, 6""" ;

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content """As of November 2018, there were 602 reports for the MedDRA preferred term ‘panic attack’ associated with LNG-IUDs in VigiBase. There were an additional nine reports that were excluded as they concerned levonorgestrel in the form of an emergency contraceptive pill. The reports were from the United States of America, Germany, France, Canada, Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Belgium, Norway, Croatia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Lithuania, Australia, Ireland, Cyprus, Slovenia, Malta, Luxembourg, Hungary and Ireland.
Sixty-two percent of the cases were considered as serious. Two cases were fatal due to the patient committing suicide, and in one case the patient died after a cardiac arrest. In 31% of the cases there was no indication for the treatment reported. In total, 69% of the reports included a specific indication for treatment. Among these, the indication was contraception in 89% of the cases, in 7% of the cases it was used to reduce bleeding and in 4% it was used for various indications such as endometriosis, oestrogen replacement therapy, etc. The patients were aged between 17 and 60 (median 33 years) for the reports that included this information. Other psychiatric terms were co- reported, such as depression (246 cases), anxiety (303), mood swings (80), depressed mood (54), suicidal ideation (42). Six percent of the cases lacked reporter qualification information. Of the 94% of the reports that did include this, 80% were from patients, 12% from physicians and 8% from pharmacists, other health care professionals and a lawyer.
Based on the overall reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for levonorgestrel and the ICSRs including panic attack in VigiBase, the association has been highlighted as significantly disproportionately reported, by IC analysis, since 2009.7 On 8 March 2019, the observed number of reports was 633 compared to the expected 204 (IC025: 1.51).
The median time to onset was five months, for the reports that included this information. In 46% of the 602 cases the drug was withdrawn. In 51% of these cases, the patient improved upon removal, and two cases reported a recurrence after the second or fourth insertion. In 98% of the reports levonorgestrel was the only suspected drug; in the remaining 2%, other drugs were also reported as co-suspected in causing the reaction. In one of these cases the co-suspected drug was levetiracetam, used to treat generalised tonic-clonic seizure, and this drug does have panic attack listed in the product information.8 In another case, venlafaxine was the co-suspected drug, but it was used to treat the panic attacks. In other cases, the co-suspected drugs were cyproterone/ethinylestradiol, etonogestrel, ethinylestradiol/etonogestrel, drospirenone/ethinylestradiol, ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel, lamotrigine, sumatriptan, prednisone, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. None of these have panic attack listed as an ADR in the EU product information.9-19 In 16% of 602 cases concomitant medication was also reported and those most frequently mentioned were levothyroxine (12 cases), sertraline (9 cases), and ibuprofen (8 cases). It is possible that some concomitant or bystander drugs may have contributed to the event.
In one of the reports with rechallenge, a woman of 34 experienced aggression, anhedonia, depression and panic attacks about two months after having the LNG-IUD inserted. At first, they are cyclical, peaking in the luteal phase of my cycle, but as the intensity increases, they affect me more of the time. From 6-7 months after having the coil inserted, they are very debilitating and affect my ability to work, socialise, and conduct relationships. From 9 months onwards, it becomes unbearable. I have used the Mirena coil [LNG-IUD] 4 times (each time for endometriosis) and have experienced the same pattern each time. Each time, I need to have it reinserted after a break, to control my endometriosis. Other interventions didn't work.
Some cases noted that women with a history of panic attacks and other disorders experienced a recurrence or exacerbation after insertion of LNG- IUD. In one case the reporter herself describes that she experienced a panic attack seven years prior when using an oral contraceptive, Cerazette (desogestrel). Twelve days after the insertion of the LNG-IUD she experienced severe panic attacks, along with difficulty breathing. The symptoms ended after discontinuation of the treatment. She had told her gynaecologist about the side effects.
He was surprised and said that the patient was the first in 20 years to have these side effects. The device was removed at the patient’s request and she has been feeling better since.
Several reports describe a positive dechallenge, where the panic attacks stopped after the LNG-IUD was removed.
•	A woman of 22 with no past medical history or prescription drug use experienced depressed mood, panic attacks, nervousness and palpitations following administration of LNG-IUD for contraception. Time to onset was three weeks. She mentioned that “the symptoms appeared gradually and those were treated with a few visits to a psychologist, without effect” After the LNG-IUD was removed the patient recovered within two and a half months.
•	A 38-year-old woman reported that, a week after insertion, she started to experience states of restlessness/agitation, which worsened and intensified to states of anxiety and panic attacks. Since she was not taking any other medication and did not experience any other stressful circumstances, she “knew” that her state must have been caused by the IUD. She removed the IUD and had recovered within a month.
The following examples illustrates the severe impact on quality of life for many of the women affected.
•	A 23-year-old woman explains that she has suffered from crippling anxiety and depression and has had numerous panic attacks since having the LNG-IUD fitted. It has affected my personal and academic life, and as a fourth-year student this has been an already stressful time and has been made worse from the anxiety and depression I have been feeling. I was not warned, neither was it stated in the pamphlet that was given to me after insertion, nor was it stated in the video I was asked to watch before considering the LNG-IUD.
•	A woman of 37 experienced panic attacks and other psychiatric disorders around one month after the insertion of an LNG-IUD. When the attending gynecologist told her that the events were not associated with her LNG-IUD use, the patient trusted that. Consequently, for more than one year the patient underwent psychiatric treatment for her condition. After LNG-IUD was removed the patient “feels better every day”. The patient stated that her marriage had almost failed. The antidepressant drugs were no longer needed and were discontinued.
•	Another compelling case concerns a woman of 29, with depressed mood, anxiety and panic attacks following insertion of LNG-IUD with a latency of two weeks. The LNG-IUD was withdrawn after two years and the patient recovered within two weeks. The reporter mentioned that the symptoms had been diagnosed as 'burn-out'. Due to her condition, the patient was unable to work for two years, but after removal of the LNG-IUD she fully recovered and was able to work again.""" ;

                     OpenPVSignal:has_content """Hormonal fluctuations during the natural cycle, as well as progestins used for hormonal contraception, can exert effects on mood especially in vulnerable women [1]. LNG-IUDs release low amounts of levonorgestrel into the uterine cavity which then reach the blood circulation [2]. In women sensitive to levonorgestrel side effects, this can lead to e.g. mood disturbance. Based on the finding that mood changes in terms of depression/depressive mood were more often observed in study subjects using LNG-IUDs compared to (non-hormonal) comparators, “Depressed mood/depression” is included in the undesirable effects section of the product information of Bayer's LNG-IUDs. These side effects of levonorgestrel are expected to occur soon after insertion of an LNG-IUD. Likewise, they are expected to resolve after removal of LNG-IUD.
Acknowledging that effects on mood are described in the LNG-IUD labels, the signal investigation performed by the PRAC in 2017 concluded that \"the available evidence does not support an association between the use of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems with isolated anxiety disorder, panic disorder, sleep disorder or restlessness\". This conclusion was based on a thorough review of data provided by the MAHs and studies performed by EMA. EMA had conducted a study in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database (large UK primary care electronical medical records database), comparing women using LNG-IUDs with those using copper IUDs [3], and a comparative analysis between LNG-IUD users and users of implantable etonogestrel in the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Pharmacovigilance (EudraVigilance) database. Within their respective limitations owing to their data source and observational studies in general, neither of these studies showed an association between LNG-IUD and panic attacks.
In accordance with the PRAC conclusion, Bayer continues to monitor events of panic attacks as part of routine safety surveillance. In addition, as agreed with PRAC, neuropsychiatric disorders (including panic attacks) have been added as secondary outcomes in Bayer's large post-authorization safety study including users of different IUDs (LNG-IUDs and copper IUD) that is currently running in ten European countries [4]. Bayer is consistently
 


updating the regulatory authorities around the world as new data become available regarding LNG- IUDs, and has worked with the agencies to make label updates when appropriate.
The PRAC review comprised the case reports from global sources in the safety databases of the MAHs and regulatory authorities and therefore likely included the cases reported to VigiBase until 2017. In this procedure Bayer provided a cumulative review of available data including a detailed analysis of the single cases recorded in the Bayer Pharmacovigilance safety database, a review of the clinical trial data and a review of information available from published literature regarding psychiatric reactions and LNG-IUD.
At the time of the analysis performed in 2017, more than 500 reports mentioning, among other events, panic attacks in Mirena users had been received by Bayer globally. The EMA/PRAC signal investigation was associated with considerable media attention, resulting in stimulated reporting of psychiatric (perceived and actual) side effects in women using LNG-IUDs. Consequently, after analysis in 2017 until end of 2018, Bayer has additionally received 280 reports mentioning panic attacks in Mirena users.
The absolute number of case reports received for a product needs to be put into relation to the product's market exposure. For Mirena, the total cumulative post-marketing experience since launch in 1990 until end of 2018 is estimated to be over 166 million woman-years. With 795 cases received for Mirena since launch, the cumulative reporting rate for panic attacks for Mirena is low with 0.5 per 100,000 woman-years of exposure. Due to stimulated reporting, the reporting rate is not constant over time: It was 0.6 per 100,000 woman- years in the two years before the PRAC signal investigation (2015-2016), and 0.9 per 100,000 in
2017-2018.
The characteristics of the case reports of panic attacks in LNG-IUD users have not changed since the signal investigation performed in 2017. An investigation of the newly registered case reports in Bayer’s safety database confirms the previous results and shows a pattern similar to the cases investigated by the UMC. The vast majority of
 
reports are not-medically confirmed consumer reports. Evaluation of cases mentioning panic attack is frequently hampered by the limited information provided. The diagnostic accuracy is unclear in many cases and there is a high overlap with symptoms referring to depression/depressed mood. Often, the described events reportedly affected general well-being. The majority of the events classified as serious, however, do not meet unequivocal seriousness criteria (such as hospitalization); additionally, in almost half of the serious cases the seriousness was determined by other co-reported events, and the event \"panic attack\" was non-serious. The described changes of the patient’s mental and/or emotional state are often difficult to interpret and due to their unspecific nature, a conclusive medical assessment of a causal association is frequently not possible. Many reports describe mood changes that are part of the spectrum of \"Depression/Depressed mood\", reactions which (as pointed out by the PRAC) are already reflected in the product information of Bayer’s LNG-IUDs.
Interpretation of disproportionate reporting of panic attacks for LNG-IUD needs to take into account that the user population of LNG-IUD (women of fertile age) is at higher risk of developing of panic attacks (compared to men or the elderly population [5]).
Additionally, the aforementioned stimulated reporting triggered by the signal investigation on psychiatric side effects of LNG-IUD has led to a further increase of reports of panic attacks in LNG- IUD users, likely contributing to the disproportionality observed in the WHO VigiBase.
The choice of a LNG-IUD is made on an individual benefit/risk assessment after careful discussion between a woman and her health care professional. The effectiveness of LNG-IUD in preventing
 
pregnancy as well as other positive effects must be considered when weighing the benefits against possible adverse effects. In the context of general contraceptive counseling, health care professionals should consider pre-existing psychological symptoms or any history of sensitivity to levonorgestrel. An LNG-IUD should only be prescribed after a full discussion and an evaluation of all contraceptive options has been made.

These reports were highlighted during a signal detection screening focusing on patient reports. In many cases, the reporter presented evidence of the significant impact on quality of life for many women during LNG-IUD use. Panic attacks may occur as a symptom in various somatic and psychiatric illnesses, but also occur in individuals without a comorbidity, as described in many of these cases. In 98% of the cases LNG-IUD was the only suspected drug and 62% of these were considered as serious. The LNG-IUD was removed in 46% of the cases. In 51% of these cases, the patient improved upon removal and two cases reported a recurrence after the second or fourth insertion. The summary of product characteristics and patient information leaflets for LNG-IUD mention, among other adverse drug reactions, depressed mood/depression – but not panic attacks. We strongly believe that the collected information in these spontaneous reports support the relationship between LNG-IUDs and panic attacks. Prescribers and patients need to be aware that panic attacks, while on an LNG-IUD, could be related to the medication and could require discontinuation of the LNG-IUD in some cases." ;
